Social Network Analysis and Network Science have a long scholarly tradition. From social diffusion models to protein-interaction networks, these complex systems disciplines cover various problems across scientific fields. Yet, although these could be seen as wildly different, the object under the microscope is the same: networks. 

With a long history (and insufficient inter-discipline collaboration, if you allow me to say) of scientific advances happening somewhat isolatedly, the potential for cross-pollination between disciplines within network science is immense.

This book attempts to compile the many methods available in the realm of complexity sciences, provide an in-depth mathematical examination--when possible--and provide a few examples illustrating their usage.

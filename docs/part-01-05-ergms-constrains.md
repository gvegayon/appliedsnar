# Using constraints in ERGMs


Exponential Random Graph Models [ERGMs] can represent a variety of
network classes. We often look at "regular" social networks
like students in schools, colleagues in a workplace, or families. Nonetheless,
some social networks we study have features that restrict how connections can
occur. Typical examples are [bi-partite graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartite_graph)
and [multilevel networks](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mlergm/vignettes/mlergm_tutorial.html).
There are two classes of vertices in bi-partite networks, and ties can only
occur between classes. On the other hand, Multilevel networks may feature
multiple classes with inter-class ties somewhat restricted. In both cases,
structural constraints exist, meaning that some configurations may not
be plausible.

Mathematically, what we are trying to do is, instead of assuming that
all network configurations are possible:

$$
\left\{\mathbf{y} \in \mathcal{Y}: y_{ij} = 0, \forall i = j\right\}
$$

\noindent we want to go a bit further avoiding loops, namely:


$$
\left\{\mathbf{y} \in \mathcal{Y}: y_{ij} = 0, \forall i = j; \mathbf{y} \in C\right\}
$$,

\noindent where $C$ is a constraint, for example, only networks with no triangles.
The `ergm` R package has built-in capabilities to deal with some of these
cases. Nonetheless, we can specify models with arbitrary
structural constraints built into the model. The key is in using offset terms.

## Example 1: Interlocking egos and disconnected alters

Imagine that we have two sets of vertices. The first, group `E`, are egos part of
an egocentric study. The second group, called `A`, is composed of people mentioned by egos in `E` but
were not surveyed. Assume that individuals in `A` can only connect
to individuals in `E`; moreover, individuals in `E` have no restrictions connecting to each other. 
In other words, only two types of ties exist: `E-E` and `A-E`. The question is
now, how can we enforce such a constraint in an ERGM?

Using offsets, and in particular, setting coefficients to `-Inf` provides
an easy way to restrict the support set of ERGMs. For example, if we wanted
to constrain the support to include networks with no triangles, we would
add the term `offset(triangle)` and use the option `offset.coef = -Inf` to
indicate that realizations including triangles are not possible. Using R:


```r
ergm(net ~ edges + offset(triangle), offset.coef = -Inf)
```

In this model, a Bernoulli graph, we reduce the sample space to networks
with no triangles. In our example, such statistic should only take non-zero
values whenever ties within the `A` class happen. We can use
the `nodematch()` term to do that. Formally

$$
\text{NodeMatch}(x) = \sum_{i,j} y_{ij} \mathbf{1}({x_{i} = x_{j}})
$$

This statistic will sum over all ties in which source ($i$) and target ($j$)'s
$X$ attribute is equal. One way to make this happen is by creating an auxiliary
variable that equals, e.g., 0 for all vertices in `A`, and a unique value
different from zero otherwise. For example, if we had 2 `A`s and three `E`s,
the data would look something like this: $\{0,0,1,2,3\}$. The following code
block creates an empty graph with 50 nodes, 10 of which are in group `E` (ego).


```r
library(ergm, quietly =  TRUE)
library(sna, quietly =  TRUE)

n <- 50
n_egos <- 10
net <- as.network(matrix(0, ncol = n, nrow = n), directed = TRUE)

# Let's assing the groups
net %v% "is.ego" <- c(rep(TRUE, n_egos), rep(FALSE, n - n_egos))
net %v% "is.ego"
```

```
##  [1]  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE
## [13] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE
## [25] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE
## [37] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE
## [49] FALSE FALSE
```

```r
gplot(net, vertex.col = net %v% "is.ego")
```

![](part-01-05-ergms-constrains_files/figure-epub3/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png)<!-- -->

To create the auxiliary variable, we will use the following function:


```r
# Function that creates an aux variable for the ergm model
make_aux_var <- function(my_net, is_ego_dummy) {
  
  n_vertex <- length(my_net %v% is_ego_dummy)
  n_ego_   <- sum(my_net %v% is_ego_dummy)
  
  # Creating an auxiliary variable to identify the non-informant non-informant ties
  my_net %v% "aux_var" <- ifelse(
    !my_net %v% is_ego_dummy, 0, 1:(n_vertex - n_ego_)
    )

  my_net
}
```


Calling the function in our data results in the following:


```r
net <- make_aux_var(net, "is.ego")

# Taking a look over the first 15 rows of data
cbind(
  Is_Ego = net %v% "is.ego",
  Aux    = net %v% "aux_var"  
) |> head(n = 15)
```

```
##       Is_Ego Aux
##  [1,]      1   1
##  [2,]      1   2
##  [3,]      1   3
##  [4,]      1   4
##  [5,]      1   5
##  [6,]      1   6
##  [7,]      1   7
##  [8,]      1   8
##  [9,]      1   9
## [10,]      1  10
## [11,]      0   0
## [12,]      0   0
## [13,]      0   0
## [14,]      0   0
## [15,]      0   0
```

We can now use this data to simulate a network in which ties between
`A`-class vertices are not possible:


```r
set.seed(2828)
net_sim <- simulate(net ~ edges + nodematch("aux_var"), coef = c(-3.0, -Inf))
gplot(net_sim, vertex.col = net_sim %v% "is.ego")
```

![](part-01-05-ergms-constrains_files/figure-epub3/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)<!-- -->

As you can see, this network has only ties of the type `E-E` and `A-E`. We can
double-check by (i) looking at the counts and (ii) visualizing each induced-subgraph
separately:


```r
summary(net_sim ~ edges + nodematch("aux_var"))
```

```
##             edges nodematch.aux_var 
##                49                 0
```

```r
net_of_alters <- get.inducedSubgraph(
  net_sim, which((net_sim %v% "aux_var") == 0)
  )

net_of_egos <- get.inducedSubgraph(
  net_sim, which((net_sim %v% "aux_var") != 0)
  )

# Counts
summary(net_of_alters ~ edges + nodematch("aux_var"))
```

```
##             edges nodematch.aux_var 
##                 0                 0
```

```r
summary(net_of_egos ~ edges + nodematch("aux_var"))
```

```
##             edges nodematch.aux_var 
##                 1                 0
```

```r
# Figures
op <- par(mfcol = c(1, 2))
gplot(net_of_alters, vertex.col = net_of_alters %v% "is.ego", main = "A")
gplot(net_of_egos, vertex.col = net_of_egos %v% "is.ego", main = "E")
```

![](part-01-05-ergms-constrains_files/figure-epub3/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)<!-- -->

```r
par(op)
```

Now, to fit an ERGM with this constraint, we simply need to make use of
the offset terms. Here is an example:


```r
ans <- ergm(
  net_sim ~ edges + offset(nodematch("aux_var")), # The model (notice the offset)
  offset.coef = -Inf                              # The offset coefficient
  )
## Starting maximum pseudolikelihood estimation (MPLE):
## Evaluating the predictor and response matrix.
## Maximizing the pseudolikelihood.
## Finished MPLE.
## Stopping at the initial estimate.
## Evaluating log-likelihood at the estimate.
summary(ans)
## Call:
## ergm(formula = net_sim ~ edges + offset(nodematch("aux_var")), 
##     offset.coef = -Inf)
## 
## Maximum Likelihood Results:
## 
##                           Estimate Std. Error MCMC % z value Pr(>|z|)    
## edges                       -2.843      0.147      0  -19.34   <1e-04 ***
## offset(nodematch.aux_var)     -Inf      0.000      0    -Inf   <1e-04 ***
## ---
## Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
## 
##      Null Deviance: 1233.8  on 2450  degrees of freedom
##  Residual Deviance:  379.4  on 2448  degrees of freedom
##  
## AIC: 381.4  BIC: 386.2  (Smaller is better. MC Std. Err. = 0)
## 
##  The following terms are fixed by offset and are not estimated:
##   offset(nodematch.aux_var)
```

This ERGM model--which by the way only featured dyadic-independent terms, and
thus can be reduced to a logistic regression--restricts the support by excluding
all networks in which ties within the class `A` exists. To finalize, let's look
at a few simulations based on this model:


```r
set.seed(1323)
op <- par(mfcol = c(2,2), mar = rep(1, 4))
for (i in 1:4) {
  gplot(simulate(ans), vertex.col = net %v% "is.ego", vertex.cex = 2)
  box()
}
```

![](part-01-05-ergms-constrains_files/figure-epub3/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)<!-- -->

```r
par(op)
```

All networks with no ties between `A` nodes.

## Example 2: Bi-partite networks

In the case of bipartite networks (sometimes called affiliation networks,) we can
use `ergm`'s terms for bipartite graphs to corroborate what we discussed
here. For example, the two-star term. Let's start simulating a bipartite
network using the `edges` and `two-star` parameters. Since the `k-star` term
is usually complex to fit (tends to generate degenerate models,) we will
take advantage of the `Log()` transformation function in the `ergm` package
to smooth the term.[^notprettyaic]

[^notprettyaic]: After writing this example, it became apparent the use of
the `Log()` transformation function may not be ideal. Since many terms used
in ERGMs can be zero, e.g., triangles, the term `Log(~ ostar(2))` is undefined
when `ostar(2) = 0`. In practice, the ERGM package sets a lower limit for the
log of 0, so, instead of having `Log(0) ~ -Inf`, they set it to be a really
large negative number. This causes all sorts of issues to the estimates; in
our example, an over estimation of the population parameter and a positive
log-likelihood. With that said, I wouldn't recommend using
this transformation too often.  

The bipartite network that we will be simulating will have 100 actors and
50 entities. Actors, which we will map to the first level of the `ergm` terms,
this is, `b1star` `b1nodematch`, etc. will send ties to the entities,
the second level of the bipartite ERGM. To create a bipartite network, we will
create an empty matrix of size `nactors x nentitites`; thus, actors are 
represented by rows and entities by columns. 


```r
# Parameters for the simulation
nactors   <- 100
nentities <- floor(nactors/2)
n         <- nactors + nentities

# Creating an empty bipartite network (baseline)
net_b <- network(
  matrix(0, nrow = nactors, ncol = nentities), bipartite = TRUE
)

# Simulating the bipartite ERGM,
net_b <- simulate(net_b ~ edges + Log(~b1star(2)), coef = c(-3, 1.5), seed = 55)
```

Let's see what we got here:


```r
summary(net_b ~ edges + Log(~b1star(2)))
```

```
##       edges Log~b1star2 
##  245.000000    5.746203
```

```r
netplot::nplot(net_b, vertex.col = (1:n <= nactors) + 1)
```

![](part-01-05-ergms-constrains_files/figure-epub3/05-example2-simulated-graph-1.png)<!-- -->

Notice that the first `nactors` vertices in the network are the actors, and
the remaining are the entities. Now, although the `ergm` package features
bipartite network terms, we can still fit a bipartite ERGM without explicitly
declaring the graph as such. In such case, the `b1star(2)` term of a bipartite
network is equivalent to an `ostar(2)` in a directed graph. Likewise, `b2star(2)`
in a bipartite graph matches the `istar(2)` term in a directed graph. This 
information will be relevant when fitting the ERGM. Let's transform the bipartite
network into a directed graph. The following code block does so:


```r
# Identifying the edges
net_not_b <- which(as.matrix(net_b) != 0, arr.ind = TRUE)

# We need to offset the endpoint of the ties by nactors
# so that the ids go from 1 through (nactors + nentitites)
net_not_b[,2] <- net_not_b[,2] + nactors

# The resulting graph is a directed network
net_not_b <- network(net_not_b, directed = TRUE)
```

Now we are almost done. As before, we need to use node-level covariates
to put the constraints in our model. For this ERGM to reflect an ERGM on
a bipartite network, we need two constraints:

1. Only ties from actors to entities are allowed, and
2. entities can only receive ties.

The corresponding offset terms for this model are: `nodematch("is.actor") ~ -Inf`,
and `nodeocov("isnot.actor") ~ -Inf`. Mathematically:

\begin{align*}
\text{NodeMatch(x = "is.actor")} &= \sum_{i<j} y_{ij}\mathbb{1}\left(x_i = x_j\right) \\
\text{NodeOCov(x = "isnot.actor")} &= \sum_{i} x_i \times \sum_{j<i} y_{ij} 
\end{align*}

In other words, we are setting that ties between nodes of the same class are
forbidden, and outgoing ties are forbidden for entities. Let's create the
vertex attributes needed to use the aforementioned terms:


```r
net_not_b %v% "is.actor" <- as.integer(1:n <= nactors)
net_not_b %v% "isnot.actor" <- as.integer(1:n > nactors)
```

Finally, to make sure we have done all well, let's look how both networks--bipartite
and unimodal--look side by side:


```r
# First, let's get the layout
fig <- netplot::nplot(net_b, vertex.col = (1:n <= nactors) + 1)
gridExtra::grid.arrange(
  fig,
  netplot::nplot(
    net_not_b, vertex.col = (1:n <= nactors) + 1,
    layout = fig$.layout
     ),
  ncol = 2, nrow = 1
)
```

![](part-01-05-ergms-constrains_files/figure-epub3/05-example2-side-by-side-1.png)<!-- -->

```r
# Looking at the counts
summary(net_b ~ edges + b1star(2) + b2star(2))
```

```
##   edges b1star2 b2star2 
##     245     313     645
```

```r
summary(net_not_b ~ edges + ostar(2) + istar(2))
```

```
##  edges ostar2 istar2 
##    245    313    645
```

With the two networks matching, we can now fit the ERGMs with and without
offset terms and compare the results between the two models:


```r
# ERGM with a bipartite graph
res_b     <- ergm(
  # Main formula
  net_b ~ edges + Log(~b1star(2)),

  # Control parameters
  control = control.ergm(seed = 1)
  )
```

```
## Warning: 'glpk' selected as the solver, but package 'Rglpk' is not available;
## falling back to 'lpSolveAPI'. This should be fine unless the sample size and/or
## the number of parameters is very big.
```

```r
# ERGM with a digraph with constraints
res_not_b <- ergm(
  # Main formula
  net_not_b ~ edges + Log(~ostar(2)) +

  # Offset terms 
  offset(nodematch("is.actor")) + offset(nodeocov("isnot.actor")),
  offset.coef = c(-Inf, -Inf),

  # Control parameters
  control = control.ergm(seed = 1)
  )
```

Here are the estimates (using the `texreg` R package for a prettier output):


```r
texreg::screenreg(list(Bipartite = res_b, Directed = res_not_b))
```

```

As expected, both models yield the "same" estimate. The minor differences
observed between the models are how the `ergm` package performs
the sampling. In particular, in the bipartite case, `ergm` has special 
routines for making the sampling more efficient, having a higher acceptance
rate than that of the model in which the bipartite graph was not explicitly
declared. We can tell this by inspecting rejection rates:


```r
data.frame(
  Bipartite = coda::rejectionRate(res_b$sample[[1]]) * 100,
  Directed  = coda::rejectionRate(res_not_b$sample[[1]][, -c(3,4)]) * 100
) |> knitr::kable(digits = 2, caption = "Rejection rate (percent)")
```



Table: (\#tab:05-example2-post-dist)Rejection rate (percent)

|            | Bipartite| Directed|
|:-----------|---------:|--------:|
|edges       |      2.48|     3.67|
|Log~b1star2 |      1.24|     2.04|

The ERGM fitted with the offset terms has a much higher rejection rate
than that of the ERGM fitted with the bipartite ERGM.

Finally, the fact that we can fit ERGMs using offset does not mean that
we need to use it ALL the time. Unless there is a very good reason to
go around `ergm`'s capabilities, I wouldn't recommend fitting bipartite
ERGMs as we just did, as the authors of the package have included (MANY) 
features to make our job easier.

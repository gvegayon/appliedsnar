Vega Yon, Ph.D. 2022-07-19 Chapter 1 Preface Statistical methods for networked systems are present in most disciplines. Nonetheless, despite the language differences between disciplines, many methods developed to study specific types of problems can be helpful outside of their original context. This project began as a part of a workshop that took place at USC’s Center for Applied Network Analysis. Now, it is a personal project that I use to gather and study statistical methods to analyze networks, emphasizing social and biological systems. Moreover, the book will use statistical computing methods as a core component when developing these topics. In general, we will, besides R itself, we will be using R studio and the following R packages: dplyr for data management, stringr for data cleaning, and of course igraph, netdiffuseR (a bit of a bias here), and statnet for our neat network analysis.1 You can access the book’s source code at https://github.com/gvegayon/appliedsnar. Some of you may be wondering “what about ggplot2 and friends? What about tidyverse”, well, my short answer is I jumped into R before all of that was that popular. When I started, plots were all about lattice, and after a couple of years on that, about base R graphics. What I’m saying is that so far, I have not found a compelling reason to leave my “old practices” and embrace all the tidyverse movement (religion?).↩ "],["about-the-author.html", "Chapter 2 About the Author", " Chapter 2 About the Author I am a Research Assistant Professor at the University of Utah’s Division of Epidemiology, where I work on studying Complex Systems using Statistical Computing. I have over ten years of experience developing scientific software focusing on high-performance computing, data visualization, and social network analysis. My training is in Public Policy (M.A. UAI, 2011), Economics (M.Sc. Caltech, 2015), and Biostatistics (Ph.D. USC, 2020).

From social diffusion models to protein-interaction networks, these complex-systems disciplines cover a wide range of problems across scientific fields. Yet, although these could be seen as wildly different, the object under the microscope is the same, networks. With a long history (and insufficient levels of inter-discipline collaboration, if you allow me to say) of scientific advances happing in a somewhat isolated fashion, the potential of cross-pollination between disciplines within network science is immense. This book is an attempt to compile the many methods available in the realm of complexity sciences, provide an in-depth mathematical examination–when possible–, and provide a few examples illustrating their usage.

For example, if you want to read the manual (help file) of the read.csv function, you can type either of these: ?read.csv ?&quot;read.csv&quot; help(read.csv) help(&quot;read.csv&quot;) If you are not fully aware of what is the name of the function, you can always use the fuzzy search help.search(&quot;linear regression&quot;) ??&quot;linear regression&quot; In R you can create new objects by either using the assign operator (&lt;-) or the equal sign =, for example, the following 2 are equivalent: a &lt;- 1 a = 1 Historically the assign operator is the most commonly used. R has several type of objects, the most basic structures in R are vectors, matrix, list, data.frame. Here is an example creating several of these (each line is enclosed with parenthesis so that R prints the resulting element): (a_vector &lt;- 1:9) ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 (another_vect &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)) ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 (a_string_vec &lt;- c(&quot;I&quot;, &quot;like&quot;, &quot;netdiffuseR&quot;)) ## [1] &quot;I&quot; &quot;like&quot; &quot;netdiffuseR&quot; (a_matrix &lt;- matrix(a_vector, ncol = 3)) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 4 7 ## [2,] 2 5 8 ## [3,] 3 6 9 (a_string_mat &lt;- matrix(letters[1:9], ncol=3)) # Matrices can be of strings too ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] &quot;a&quot; &quot;d&quot; &quot;g&quot; ## [2,] &quot;b&quot; &quot;e&quot; &quot;h&quot; ## [3,] &quot;c&quot; &quot;f&quot; &quot;i&quot; (another_mat &lt;- cbind(1:4, 11:14)) # The `cbind` operator does &quot;column bind&quot; ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] 1 11 ## [2,] 2 12 ## [3,] 3 13 ## [4,] 4 14 (another_mat2 &lt;- rbind(1:4, 11:14)) # The `rbind` operator does &quot;row bind&quot; ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] ## [1,] 1 2 3 4 ## [2,] 11 12 13 14 (a_string_mat &lt;- matrix(letters[1:9], ncol = 3)) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] &quot;a&quot; &quot;d&quot; &quot;g&quot; ## [2,] &quot;b&quot; &quot;e&quot; &quot;h&quot; ## [3,] &quot;c&quot; &quot;f&quot; &quot;i&quot; (a_list &lt;- list(a_vector, a_matrix)) ## [[1]] ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ## ## [[2]] ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 4 7 ## [2,] 2 5 8 ## [3,] 3 6 9 (another_list &lt;- list(my_vec = a_vector, my_mat = a_matrix)) # same but with names! ## $my_vec ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ## ## $my_mat ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 4 7 ## [2,] 2 5 8 ## [3,] 3 6 9 # Data frames can have multiple types of elements, it is a collection of lists (a_data_frame &lt;- data.frame(x = 1:10, y = letters[1:10])) ## x y ## 1 1 a ## 2 2 b ## 3 3 c ## 4 4 d ## 5 5 e ## 6 6 f ## 7 7 g ## 8 8 h ## 9 9 i ## 10 10 j Depending on the type of object, we can access to its components using indexing: a_vector[1:3] # First 3 elements ## [1] 1 2 3 a_string_vec[3] # Third element ## [1] &quot;netdiffuseR&quot; a_matrix[1:2, 1:2] # A sub matrix ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] 1 4 ## [2,] 2 5 a_matrix[,3] # Third column ## [1] 7 8 9 a_matrix[3,] # Third row ## [1] 3 6 9 a_string_mat[1:6] # First 6 elements of the matrix.

In general, distribution functions have the following name structure: Random Number Generation: r[name-of-the-distribution], e.g. rnorm for normal, runif for uniform. Density function: d[name-of-the-distribution], e.g. dnorm for normal, dunif for uniform. Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF): p[name-of-the-distribution], e.g. pnorm for normal, punif for uniform. Inverse (quantile) function: q[name-of-the-distribution], e.g. qnorm for the normal, qunif for the uniform. Here are some examples: # To ensure reproducibility set.seed(1231) # 100,000 Unif(0,1) numbers x &lt;- runif(1e5) hist(x) # 100,000 N(0,1) numbers x &lt;- rnorm(1e5) hist(x) # 100,000 N(10,25) numbers x &lt;- rnorm(1e5, mean = 10, sd = 5) hist(x) # 100,000 Poisson(5) numbers x &lt;- rpois(1e5, lambda = 5) hist(x) # 100,000 rexp(5) numbers x &lt;- rexp(1e5, 5) hist(x) More distributions are available at ??Distributions.

In this case, since both variables are numeric, a good way of doing it is to encode the id. For example, the last three numbers are the photoid and the first ones are the school id. To do this, we need to take into account the range of the variables: (photo_id_ran &lt;- range(dat$photoid)) ## [1] 1 2074 As the variable spans up to 2074, we need to set the last 4 units of the variable to store the photoid. We will use dplyr (Wickham et al. 2017) and magrittr (Bache and Wickham 2014)] (the pipe operator, %&gt;%) to create this variable, and we will call it… id (mind blowing, right?): library(dplyr) ## ## Attaching package: &#39;dplyr&#39; ## The following objects are masked from &#39;package:stats&#39;: ## ## filter, lag ## The following objects are masked from &#39;package:base&#39;: ## ## intersect, setdiff, setequal, union library(magrittr) (dat %&lt;&gt;% mutate(id = school*10000 + photoid)) %&gt;% head %&gt;% select(school, photoid, id) ## school photoid id ## 1 111 1 1110001 ## 2 111 2 1110002 ## 3 111 7 1110007 ## 4 111 13 1110013 ## 5 111 14 1110014 ## 6 111 15 1110015 Wow, what happened in the last three lines of code! What is that %&gt;%? Well, that’s the pipe operator, and it is an appealing way of writing nested function calls. In this case, instead of writing something like: dat_filtered$id &lt;- dat_filtered$school*10000 + dat_filtered$photoid subset(head(dat_filtered), select = c(school, photoid, id)) References "],["creating-a-network.html", "5.2 Creating a network", " 5.2 Creating a network We want to build a social network.

In this case, we will create the network by coercing the dataset into an edgelist. 5.2.1 From survey to edgelist Let’s start by loading a couple of handy R packages. We will load tidyr (Wickham and Henry 2017) and stringr (Wickham 2017). We will use the first, tidyr, to reshape the data. The second, stringr, will help us processing strings using regular expressions3. library(tidyr) library(stringr) Optionally, we can use the tibble type of object, which is an alternative to the actual data.frame.

For the later, we use the function starts_with (from the tidyselect package). The latter allows us to select all variables that start with the word “sch_friend”, which means that sch_friend11, sch_friend12, ... will be selected. dat %&gt;% select(id, school, starts_with(&quot;sch_friend&quot;)) ## # A tibble: 2,164 × 78 ## id school sch_friend11 sch_friend12 sch_friend13 sch_friend14 ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 1110001 111 NA NA NA NA ## 2 1110002 111 424 423 426 289 ## 3 1110007 111 629 505 NA NA ## 4 1110013 111 232 569 NA NA ## 5 1110014 111 582 134 41 592 ## 6 1110015 111 26 488 81 138 ## 7 1110020 111 528 NA 492 395 ## 8 1110022 111 NA NA NA NA ## 9 1110025 111 135 185 553 84 ## 10 1110027 111 346 168 559 5 ## # … with 2,154 more rows, and 72 more variables: sch_friend15 &lt;int&gt;, ## # sch_friend16 &lt;int&gt;, sch_friend17 &lt;int&gt;, sch_friend18 &lt;int&gt;, ## # sch_friend19 &lt;int&gt;, sch_friend110 &lt;int&gt;, sch_friend111 &lt;int&gt;, ## # sch_friend112 &lt;int&gt;, sch_friend113 &lt;int&gt;, sch_friend114 &lt;int&gt;, ## # sch_friend115 &lt;int&gt;, sch_friend116 &lt;int&gt;, sch_friend117 &lt;int&gt;, ## # sch_friend118 &lt;int&gt;, sch_friend119 &lt;int&gt;, sch_friend21 &lt;int&gt;, ## # sch_friend22 &lt;int&gt;, sch_friend23 &lt;int&gt;, sch_friend24 &lt;int&gt;, … Then, we reshape it to long format: By transposing all the sch_friend* to long format. We do this using the function gather (from the tidyr package); an alternative to the reshape function, which I find easier to use. Let’s see how it works: dat %&gt;% select(id, school, starts_with(&quot;sch_friend&quot;)) %&gt;% gather(key = &quot;varname&quot;, value = &quot;content&quot;, -id, -school) ## # A tibble: 164,464 × 4 ## id school varname content ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 1110001 111 sch_friend11 NA ## 2 1110002 111 sch_friend11 424 ## 3 1110007 111 sch_friend11 629 ## 4 1110013 111 sch_friend11 232 ## 5 1110014 111 sch_friend11 582 ## 6 1110015 111 sch_friend11 26 ## 7 1110020 111 sch_friend11 528 ## 8 1110022 111 sch_friend11 NA ## 9 1110025 111 sch_friend11 135 ## 10 1110027 111 sch_friend11 346 ## # … with 164,454 more rows In this case, the key parameter sets the name of the variable that will contain the name of the variable that was reshaped, while value is the name of the variable that will hold the content of the data (that’s why I named those like that). The -id, -school bit tells the function to “drop” those variables before reshaping. In other words, “reshape everything but id and school.” Also, notice that we passed from 2164 rows to 19 (nominations) * 2164 (subjects) * 4 (waves) = 164464 rows, as expected. As the nomination data can be empty for some cells, we need to take care of those cases, the NAs, so we filter the data: dat %&gt;% select(id, school, starts_with(&quot;sch_friend&quot;)) %&gt;% gather(key = &quot;varname&quot;, value = &quot;content&quot;, -id, -school) %&gt;% filter(!is.na(content)) ## # A tibble: 39,561 × 4 ## id school varname content ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 1110002 111 sch_friend11 424 ## 2 1110007 111 sch_friend11 629 ## 3 1110013 111 sch_friend11 232 ## 4 1110014 111 sch_friend11 582 ## 5 1110015 111 sch_friend11 26 ## 6 1110020 111 sch_friend11 528 ## 7 1110025 111 sch_friend11 135 ## 8 1110027 111 sch_friend11 346 ## 9 1110029 111 sch_friend11 369 ## 10 1110030 111 sch_friend11 462 ## # … with 39,551 more rows And finally, we create three new variables from this dataset: friendid,, year, and nom_num (nomination number). All using regular expressions: dat %&gt;% select(id, school, starts_with(&quot;sch_friend&quot;)) %&gt;% gather(key = &quot;varname&quot;, value = &quot;content&quot;, -id, -school) %&gt;% filter(!is.na(content)) %&gt;% mutate( friendid = school*10000 + content, year = as.integer(str_extract(varname, &quot;(?&lt;=[a-z])[0-9]&quot;)), nnom = as.integer(str_extract(varname, &quot;(?&lt;=[a-z][0-9])[0-9]+&quot;)) ) ## # A tibble: 39,561 × 7 ## id school varname content friendid year nnom ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 1110002 111 sch_friend11 424 1110424 1 1 ## 2 1110007 111 sch_friend11 629 1110629 1 1 ## 3 1110013 111 sch_friend11 232 1110232 1 1 ## 4 1110014 111 sch_friend11 582 1110582 1 1 ## 5 1110015 111 sch_friend11 26 1110026 1 1 ## 6 1110020 111 sch_friend11 528 1110528 1 1 ## 7 1110025 111 sch_friend11 135 1110135 1 1 ## 8 1110027 111 sch_friend11 346 1110346 1 1 ## 9 1110029 111 sch_friend11 369 1110369 1 1 ## 10 1110030 111 sch_friend11 462 1110462 1 1 ## # … with 39,551 more rows The regular expression (?&lt;=[a-z]) matches a string preceded by any letter from a to z. In contrast, the expression [0-9] matches a single number. Hence, from the string \"sch_friend12\", the regular expression will only match the 1, as it is the only number followed by a letter. The expression (?&lt;=[a-z][0-9]) matches a string preceded by a lower case letter and a one-digit number. Finally, the expression [0-9]+ matches a string of numbers–so it could be more than one. Hence, from the string \"sch_friend12\", we will get 2: str_extract(&quot;sch_friend12&quot;, &quot;(?&lt;=[a-z])[0-9]&quot;) ## [1] &quot;1&quot; str_extract(&quot;sch_friend12&quot;, &quot;(?&lt;=[a-z][0-9])[0-9]+&quot;) ## [1] &quot;2&quot; And finally, the as.integer function coerces the returning value from the str_extract function from character to integer. Now that we have this edgelist, we can create an igraph object 5.2.2 igraph network For coercing the edgelist into an igraph object, we will be using the graph_from_data_frame function in igraph (Csardi and Nepusz 2006). This function receives the following arguments: a data frame where the two first columns are “source” (ego) and “target” (alter), an indicator of whether the network is directed or not, and an optional data frame with vertices, in which’s first column should contain the vertex ids. Using the optional vertices argument is a good practice since, by doing so, you are telling the function what ids that you are expecting to find. Using the original dataset, we will create a data frame name vertices: vertex_attrs &lt;- dat %&gt;% select(id, school, hispanic, female1, starts_with(&quot;eversmk&quot;)) Now, let’s now use the function graph_from_data_frame to create an igraph object: library(igraph) ig_year1 &lt;- net %&gt;% filter(year == &quot;1&quot;) %&gt;% select(id, friendid, nnom) %&gt;% graph_from_data_frame( vertices = vertex_attrs ) ## Error in graph_from_data_frame(., vertices = vertex_attrs): Some vertex names in edge list are not listed in vertex data frame Ups! It seems that individuals are making nominations to other students not included in the survey. How to solve that? Well, it all depends on what you need to do! In this case, we will go for the quietly-remove-em’-and-don’t-tell strategy: ig_year1 &lt;- net %&gt;% filter(year == &quot;1&quot;) %&gt;% # Extra line, all nominations must be in ego too. filter(friendid %in% id) %&gt;% select(id, friendid, nnom) %&gt;% graph_from_data_frame( vertices = vertex_attrs ) ig_year1 ## IGRAPH f7e446a DN-- 2164 9514 -- ## + attr: name (v/c), school (v/n), hispanic (v/n), female1 (v/n), ## | eversmk1 (v/n), eversmk2 (v/n), eversmk3 (v/n), eversmk4 (v/n), nnom ## | (e/n) ## + edges from f7e446a (vertex names): ## [1] 1110007-&gt;1110629 1110013-&gt;1110232 1110014-&gt;1110582 1110015-&gt;1110026 ## [5] 1110025-&gt;1110135 1110027-&gt;1110346 1110029-&gt;1110369 1110035-&gt;1110034 ## [9] 1110040-&gt;1110390 1110041-&gt;1110557 1110044-&gt;1110027 1110046-&gt;1110030 ## [13] 1110050-&gt;1110086 1110057-&gt;1110263 1110069-&gt;1110544 1110071-&gt;1110167 ## [17] 1110072-&gt;1110289 1110073-&gt;1110014 1110075-&gt;1110352 1110084-&gt;1110305 ## [21] 1110086-&gt;1110206 1110093-&gt;1110040 1110094-&gt;1110483 1110095-&gt;1110043 ## + ... omitted several edges So there we have our network with 2164 nodes and 9514 edges. The following steps: get some descriptive stats and visualize our network. References "],["network-descriptive-stats.html", "5.3 Network descriptive stats", " 5.3 Network descriptive stats While we could do all networks at once, in this part, we will focus on computing some network statistics for one of the schools only. We start by school 111. The first question that you should be asking yourself now is, “how can I get that information from the igraph object?.” Vertex and edges attributes can be accessed via the V and E functions, respectively; moreover, we can list what vertex/edge attributes are available: list.vertex.attributes(ig_year1) ## [1] &quot;name&quot; &quot;school&quot; &quot;hispanic&quot; &quot;female1&quot; &quot;eversmk1&quot; &quot;eversmk2&quot; &quot;eversmk3&quot; ## [8] &quot;eversmk4&quot; list.edge.attributes(ig_year1) ## [1] &quot;nnom&quot; Just like we would do with data frames, accessing vertex attributes is done via the dollar sign operator $. Together with the V function; for example, accessing the first ten elements of the variable hispanic can be done as follows: V(ig_year1)$hispanic[1:10] ## [1] 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 Now that you know how to access vertex attributes, we can get the network corresponding to school 111 by identifying which vertices are part of it and pass that information to the induced_subgraph function: # Which ids are from school 111? school111ids &lt;- which(V(ig_year1)$school == 111) # Creating a subgraph ig_year1_111 &lt;- induced_subgraph( graph = ig_year1, vids = school111ids ) The which function in R returns a vector of indices indicating which elements pass the test, returning true and false, otherwise. In our case, it will result in a vector of indices of the vertices which have the attribute school equal to 111. With the subgraph, we can compute different centrality measures4 for each vertex and store them in the igraph object itself: # Computing centrality measures for each vertex V(ig_year1_111)$indegree &lt;- degree(ig_year1_111, mode = &quot;in&quot;) V(ig_year1_111)$outdegree &lt;- degree(ig_year1_111, mode = &quot;out&quot;) V(ig_year1_111)$closeness &lt;- closeness(ig_year1_111, mode = &quot;total&quot;) V(ig_year1_111)$betweeness &lt;- betweenness(ig_year1_111, normalized = TRUE) From here, we can go back to our old habits and get the set of vertex attributes as a data frame so we can compute some summary statistics on the centrality measurements that we just got # Extracting each vectex features as a data.frame stats &lt;- as_data_frame(ig_year1_111, what = &quot;vertices&quot;) # Computing quantiles for each variable stats_degree &lt;- with(stats, { cbind( indegree = quantile(indegree, c(.025, .5, .975), na.rm = TRUE), outdegree = quantile(outdegree, c(.025, .5, .975), na.rm = TRUE), closeness = quantile(closeness, c(.025, .5, .975), na.rm = TRUE), betweeness = quantile(betweeness, c(.025, .5, .975), na.rm = TRUE) ) }) stats_degree ## indegree outdegree closeness betweeness ## 2.5% 0 0 0.0005915148 0.000000000 ## 50% 4 4 0.0007487833 0.001879006 ## 97.5% 16 16 0.0008838413 0.016591048 The with function is somewhat similar to what dplyr allows us to do when we want to work with the dataset but without mentioning its name everytime that we ask for a variable. Without using the with function, the previous could have been done as follows: stats_degree &lt;- cbind( indegree = quantile(stats$indegree, c(.025, .5, .975), na.rm = TRUE), outdegree = quantile(stats$outdegree, c(.025, .5, .975), na.rm = TRUE), closeness = quantile(stats$closeness, c(.025, .5, .975), na.rm = TRUE), betweeness = quantile(stats$betweeness, c(.025, .5, .975), na.rm = TRUE) ) Now we will compute some statistics at the graph level: cbind( size = vcount(ig_year1_111), nedges = ecount(ig_year1_111), density = edge_density(ig_year1_111), recip = reciprocity(ig_year1_111), centr = centr_betw(ig_year1_111)$centralization, pathLen = mean_distance(ig_year1_111) ) ## size nedges density recip centr pathLen ## [1,] 533 2638 0.009303277 0.3731513 0.02179154 4.23678 Triadic census triadic &lt;- triad_census(ig_year1_111) triadic ## [1] 24059676 724389 290849 3619 3383 4401 3219 2997 ## [9] 407 33 836 235 163 137 277 85 To get a nicer view of this, we can use a table that I retrieved from ?triad_census.

It turns out that sum(triadic) = choose(n, 3)! So either approach is correct.↩ "],["plotting-the-network-in-igraph.html", "5.4 Plotting the network in igraph", " 5.4 Plotting the network in igraph 5.4.1 Single plot Let’s take a look at how does our network looks like when we use the default parameters in the plot method of the igraph object: plot(ig_year1) Figure 5.1: A not very nice network plot. This is what we get with the default parameters in igraph. Not very nice, right? A couple of things with this plot: We are looking at all schools simultaneously, which does not make sense. So, instead of plotting ig_year1, we will focus on ig_year1_111. All the vertices have the same size and are overlapping. Instead of using the default size, we will size the vertices by indegree using the degree function and passing the vector of degrees to vertex.size.6 Given the number of vertices in these networks, the labels are not useful here. So we will remove them by setting vertex.label = NA. Moreover, we will reduce the size of the arrows’ tip by setting edge.arrow.size = 0.25. And finally, we will set the color of each vertex to be a function of whether the individual is Hispanic or not. For this last bit we need to go a bit more of programming: col_hispanic &lt;- V(ig_year1_111)$hispanic + 1 col_hispanic &lt;- coalesce(col_hispanic, 3) col_hispanic &lt;- c(&quot;steelblue&quot;, &quot;tomato&quot;, &quot;white&quot;)[col_hispanic] Line by line, we did the following: The first line added one to all no NA values so that the 0s (non-Hispanic) turned to 1s and the 1s (Hispanic) turned to 2s. The second line replaced all NAs with the number three so that our vector col_hispanic now ranges from one to three with no NAs in it. In the last line, we created a vector of colors. Essentially, what we are doing here is telling R to create a vector of length length(col_hispanic) by selecting elements by index from the vector c(\"steelblue\", \"tomato\", \"white\"). This way, if, for example, the first element of the vector col_hispanic was a 3, our new vector of colors would have a \"white\" in it. To make sure we know we are right, let’s print the first 10 elements of our new vector of colors together with the original hispanic column: cbind( original = V(ig_year1_111)$hispanic[1:10], colors = col_hispanic[1:10] ) ## original colors ## [1,] &quot;1&quot; &quot;tomato&quot; ## [2,] &quot;1&quot; &quot;tomato&quot; ## [3,] &quot;0&quot; &quot;steelblue&quot; ## [4,] &quot;1&quot; &quot;tomato&quot; ## [5,] &quot;1&quot; &quot;tomato&quot; ## [6,] &quot;1&quot; &quot;tomato&quot; ## [7,] &quot;1&quot; &quot;tomato&quot; ## [8,] &quot;1&quot; &quot;tomato&quot; ## [9,] &quot;0&quot; &quot;steelblue&quot; ## [10,] &quot;1&quot; &quot;tomato&quot; With our nice vector of colors, now we can pass it to plot.igraph (which we call implicitly by just calling plot), via the vertex.color argument: # Fancy graph set.seed(1) plot( ig_year1_111, vertex.size = degree(ig_year1_111)/10 +1, vertex.label = NA, edge.arrow.size = .25, vertex.color = col_hispanic ) Figure 5.2: Friends network in time 1 for school 111. Nice! So it does look better. The only problem is that we have a lot of isolates. Let’s try again by drawing the same plot without isolates. To do so, we need to filter the graph, for which we will use the function induced_subgraph # Which vertices are not isolates? which_ids &lt;- which(degree(ig_year1_111, mode = &quot;total&quot;) &gt; 0) # Getting the subgraph ig_year1_111_sub &lt;- induced_subgraph(ig_year1_111, which_ids) # We need to get the same subset in col_hispanic col_hispanic &lt;- col_hispanic[which_ids] # Fancy graph set.seed(1) plot( ig_year1_111_sub, vertex.size = degree(ig_year1_111_sub)/5 +1, vertex.label = NA, edge.arrow.size = .25, vertex.color = col_hispanic ) Figure 5.3: Friends network in time 1 for school 111. The graph excludes isolates. Now that’s better! An interesting pattern that shows up is that individuals seem to cluster by whether they are Hispanic or not. We can write this as a function to avoid copying and pasting the code \\(n\\) times (supposing that we want to create a plot similar to this \\(n\\) times). We do the latter in the following subsection. 5.4.2 Multiple plots When you are repeating yourself repeatedly, it is a good idea to write down a sequence of commands as a function. In this case, since we will be running the same type of plot for all schools/waves, we write a function in which the only things that change are: (a) the school id, and (b) the color of the nodes. myplot &lt;- function( net, schoolid, mindgr = 1, vcol = &quot;tomato&quot;, ...) { # Creating a subgraph subnet &lt;- induced_subgraph( net, which(degree(net, mode = &quot;all&quot;) &gt;= mindgr &amp; V(net)$school == schoolid) ) # Fancy graph set.seed(1) plot( subnet, vertex.size = degree(subnet)/5, vertex.label = NA, edge.arrow.size = .25, vertex.color = vcol, ... ) } The function definition: The myplot &lt;- function([arguments]) {[body of the function]} tells R that we are going to create a function called myplot. We declare four specific arguments: net, schoolid, mindgr, and vcol. These are an igraph object, the school id, the minimum degree that vertices must have to be included in the figure, and the color of the vertices. Observe that, compared to other programming languages, R does not require declaring the data types. The ellipsis object, ..., is an especial object in R that allows us to pass other arguments without specifying which. If you take a look at the plot bit in the function body, you will see that we also added .... We use the ellipsis to pass extra arguments (different from the ones that we explicitly defined) directly to plot. In practice, this implies that we can, for example, set the argument edge.arrow.size when calling myplot, even though we did not include it in the function definition! (See ?dotsMethods in R for more details). In the following lines of code, using our new function, we will plot each schools’ network in the same plotting device (window) with the help of the par function, and add legend with the legend: # Plotting all together oldpar &lt;- par(no.readonly = TRUE) par(mfrow = c(2, 3), mai = rep(0, 4), oma= c(1, 0, 0, 0)) myplot(ig_year1, 111, vcol = &quot;tomato&quot;) myplot(ig_year1, 112, vcol = &quot;steelblue&quot;) myplot(ig_year1, 113, vcol = &quot;black&quot;) myplot(ig_year1, 114, vcol = &quot;gold&quot;) myplot(ig_year1, 115, vcol = &quot;white&quot;) par(oldpar) # A fancy legend legend( &quot;bottomright&quot;, legend = c(111, 112, 113, 114, 115), pt.bg = c(&quot;tomato&quot;, &quot;steelblue&quot;, &quot;black&quot;, &quot;gold&quot;, &quot;white&quot;), pch = 21, cex = 1, bty = &quot;n&quot;, title = &quot;School&quot; ) Figure 5.4: All 5 schools in time 1. Again, the graphs exclude isolates. So what happened here? oldpar &lt;- par(no.readonly = TRUE) This line stores the current parameters for plotting. Since we are going to be changing them, we better make sure we are able to go back!. par(mfrow = c(2, 3), mai = rep(0, 4), oma=rep(0, 4)) Here we are setting various things at the same time. mfrow specifies how many figures will be drawn, and in what order. In particular, we are asking the plotting device to make room for 2*3 = 6 figures organized in two rows and three columns drawn by row. mai specifies the size of the margins in inches, setting all margins equal to zero (which is what we are doing now) gives more space to the graph. The same is true for oma. See ?par for more info. myplot(ig_year1, ...) This is simply calling our plotting function. The neat part of this is that, since we set mfrow = c(2, 3), R takes care of distributing the plots in the device. par(oldpar) This line allows us to restore the plotting parameters. Figuring out what is the optimal vertex size is a bit tricky. Without getting too technical, there’s no other way of getting nice vertex size other than just playing with different values of it. A nice solution to this is using netdiffuseR::igraph_vertex_rescale which rescales the vertices so that these keep their aspect ratio to a predefined proportion of the screen.↩ "],["statistical-tests.html", "5.5 Statistical tests", " 5.5 Statistical tests 5.5.1 Is nomination number correlated with indegree?

To this end, a network dataset, like those depicted in Figure 1, may be considered as the response in a regression model, where the predictors are things like “propensity for individuals of the same sex to form partnerships” or “propensity for individuals to form triangles of partnerships”. In Figure 1(b), for example, it is evident that the individual nodes appear to cluster in groups of the same numerical labels (which turn out to be students’ grades, 7 through 12); thus, an ERGM can help us quantify the strength of this intra-group effect. — (David R.

Model (6.1) may be expanded by replacing \\(\\mathbf{g}(\\mathbf{y})\\) with \\(\\mathbf{g}(\\mathbf{y}, \\mathbf{X})\\) to allow for additional covariate information \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) about the network. The denominator, \\[ \\kappa\\left(\\theta,\\mathcal{Y}\\right) = \\sum_{\\mathbf{y}\\in\\mathcal{Y}}\\mbox{exp}\\left\\{\\theta^{\\mbox{T}}\\mathbf{g}(\\mathbf{y})\\right\\} \\] ,is the normalizing factor that ensures that equation (6.1) is a legitimate probability distribution. Even after fixing \\(\\mathcal{Y}\\) to be all the networks that have size \\(n\\), the size of \\(\\mathcal{Y}\\) makes this type of statistical model hard to estimate as there are \\(N = 2^{n(n-1)}\\) possible networks! (David R. Hunter et al. 2008) Recent developments include new forms of dependency structures to take into account more general neighborhood effects. These models relax the one-step Markovian dependence assumptions, allowing investigation of longer-range configurations, such as longer paths in the network or larger cycles (Pattison and Robins 2002). Models for bipartite (Faust and Skvoretz 1999) and tripartite (Mische and Robins 2000) network structures have been developed. (David R.

In a standard setting, we would be able to use Maximum-Likelihood-Estimation (MLE), which consists of finding the model parameters \\(\\theta\\) that, given the observed data, maximize the likelihood of the model. For the latter, we generally use Newton’s method. Newton’s method requires been able to compute the log-likelihood of the model, which in ERGMs can be challenging. For ERGMs, since part of the likelihood involves a normalizing constant that is a function of all possible networks, this is not as straightforward as in the regular setting. Because of it, most estimation methods rely on simulations. In statnet, the default estimation method is based on a method proposed by (Geyer and Thompson 1992), Markov-Chain MLE, which uses Markov-Chain Monte Carlo for simulating networks and a modified version of the Newton-Raphson algorithm to estimate the parameters. The idea of MC-MLE for this family of statistical models is that we can approximate the expectation of normalizing constant ratios using the law of large numbers. In particular, the following: \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{\\kappa\\left(\\theta,\\mathcal{Y}\\right)}{\\kappa\\left(\\theta_0,\\mathcal{Y}\\right)} &amp; = \\frac{ \\sum_{\\mathbf{y}\\in\\mathcal{Y}}\\mbox{exp}\\left\\{\\theta^{\\mbox{T}}\\mathbf{g}(\\mathbf{y})\\right\\}}{ \\sum_{\\mathbf{y}\\in\\mathcal{Y}}\\mbox{exp}\\left\\{\\theta_0^{\\mbox{T}}\\mathbf{g}(\\mathbf{y})\\right\\} } \\\\ &amp; = \\sum_{\\mathbf{y}\\in\\mathcal{Y}}\\left( % \\frac{1}{% \\sum_{\\mathbf{y}\\in\\mathcal{Y}\\mbox{exp}\\left\\{\\theta_0^{\\mbox{T}}\\mathbf{g}(\\mathbf{y})\\right\\}}% } \\times % \\mbox{exp}\\left\\{\\theta^{\\mbox{T}}\\mathbf{g}(\\mathbf{y})\\right\\} % \\right) \\\\ &amp; = \\sum_{\\mathbf{y}\\in\\mathcal{Y}}\\left( % \\frac{\\mbox{exp}\\left\\{\\theta_0^{\\mbox{T}}\\mathbf{g}(\\mathbf{y})\\right\\}}{% \\sum_{\\mathbf{y}\\in\\mathcal{Y}\\mbox{exp}\\left\\{\\theta_0^{\\mbox{T}}\\mathbf{g}(\\mathbf{y})\\right\\}}% } \\times % \\mbox{exp}\\left\\{(\\theta - \\theta_0)^{\\mbox{T}}\\mathbf{g}(\\mathbf{y})\\right\\} % \\right) \\\\ &amp; = \\sum_{\\mathbf{y}\\in\\mathcal{Y}}\\left( % \\mbox{Pr}\\left(Y = y|\\mathcal{Y}, \\theta_0\\right) \\times % \\mbox{exp}\\left\\{(\\theta - \\theta_0)^{\\mbox{T}}\\mathbf{g}(\\mathbf{y})\\right\\} % \\right) \\\\ &amp; = \\mbox{E}_{\\theta_0}\\left(\\mbox{exp}\\left\\{(\\theta - \\theta_0)^{\\mbox{T}}\\mathbf{g}(\\mathbf{y})\\right\\} \\right) \\end{align*}\\] In particular, the MC-MLE algorithm uses this fact to maximize the ratio of log-likelihoods. The objective function itself can be approximated by simulating \\(m\\) networks from the distribution with parameter \\(\\theta_0\\): \\[ l(\\theta) - l(\\theta_0) \\approx (\\theta - \\theta_0)^{\\mbox{T}}\\mathbf{g}(\\mathbf{y}_{obs}) - \\mbox{log}{\\left[\\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{i = 1}^m\\mbox{exp}\\left\\{(\\theta-\\theta_0)^{\\mbox{T}}\\right\\}\\mathbf{g}(\\mathbf{Y}_i)\\right]} \\] For more details, see (David R. Hunter et al. 2008). A sketch of the algorithm follows: Initialize the algorithm with an initial guess of \\(\\theta\\), call it \\(\\theta^{(t)}\\) (must be a rather OK guess) While (no convergence) do: Using \\(\\theta^{(t)}\\), simulate \\(M\\) networks by means of small changes in the \\(\\mathbf{Y}_{obs}\\) (the observed network). This part is done by using an importance-sampling method which weights each proposed network by it’s likelihood conditional on \\(\\theta^{(t)}\\) With the networks simulated, we can do the Newton step to update the parameter \\(\\theta^{(t)}\\) (this is the iteration part in the ergm package): \\(\\theta^{(t)}\\to\\theta^{(t+1)}\\). If convergence has been reached (which usually means that \\(\\theta^{(t)}\\) and \\(\\theta^{(t + 1)}\\) are not very different), then stop; otherwise, go to step a. For more details see (Lusher, Koskinen, and Robins 2012; Admiraal and Handcock 2006; Snijders 2002; Wang et al. 2009) provides details on the algorithm used by PNet (which is the same as the one used in RSiena). (Lusher, Koskinen, and Robins 2012) provides a short discussion on differences between ergm and PNet. References "],["the-ergm-package.html", "6.3 The ergm package", " 6.3 The ergm package The ergm R package (Handcock et al. 2017) From the previous section:7 library(igraph) library(magrittr) library(dplyr) load(&quot;03.rda&quot;) In this section we will use the ergm package (from the statnet suit of packages (Handcock et al. 2016)) suit, and the intergraph (Bojanowski 2015) package. The latter provides functions to go back and forth between igraph and network objects from the igraph and network packages respectively8 library(ergm) library(intergraph) As a rather important side note, the order in which R packages are loaded matters. Why is this important to mention now? Well, it turns out that at least a couple of functions in the network package have the same name of some functions in the igraph package. When the ergm package is loaded, since it depends on network, it will load the network package first, which will mask some functions in igraph. This becomes evident once you load ergm after loading igraph: The following objects are masked from ‘package:igraph’: add.edges, add.vertices, %c%, delete.edges, delete.vertices, get.edge.attribute, get.edges, get.vertex.attribute, is.bipartite, is.directed, list.edge.attributes, list.vertex.attributes, %s%, set.edge.attribute, set.vertex.attribute What are the implications of this? If you call the function list.edge.attributes for an object of class igraph R will return an error as the first function that matches that name comes from the network package! To avoid this you can use the double colon notation: igraph::list.edge.attributes(my_igraph_object) network::list.edge.attributes(my_network_object) Anyway… Using the asNetwork function, we can coerce the igraph object into a network object so we can use it with the ergm function: # Creating the new network network_111 &lt;- intergraph::asNetwork(ig_year1_111) # Running a simple ergm (only fitting edge count) ergm(network_111 ~ edges) ## [1] &quot;Warning: This network contains loops&quot; ## Starting maximum pseudolikelihood estimation (MPLE): ## Evaluating the predictor and response matrix. ## Maximizing the pseudolikelihood. ## Finished MPLE. ## Stopping at the initial estimate. ## Evaluating log-likelihood at the estimate. ## ## Call: ## ergm(formula = network_111 ~ edges) ## ## Maximum Likelihood Coefficients: ## edges ## -4.734 So what happened here!

This implies that, since we are running the model with more than 1 chain, we can use all the samples (chains) as a single dataset. Recent changes in the ergm estimation algorithm mean that these plots can no longer be used to ensure that the mean statistics from the model match the observed network statistics. For that functionality, please use the GOF command: gof(object, GOF=~model). —?ergm::mcmc.diagnostics Since ans0 is the one model which did best, let’s take a look at it’s GOF statistics. First, lets see how the MCMC did. For this we can use the mcmc.diagnostics function including in the package. This function is actually a wrapper of a couple of functions from the coda package (Plummer et al. 2006) which is called upon the $sample object which holds the centered statistics from the sampled networks. This last point is important to consider since at first look it can be confusing to look at the $sample object since it neither matches the observed statistics, nor the coefficients. When calling the function mcmc.diagnostics(ans0, centered = FALSE), you will see a lot of output including a couple of plots showing the trace and posterior distribution of the uncentered statistics (centered = FALSE). In the next code chunks we will reproduce the output from the mcmc.diagnostics function step by step using the coda package. First we need to uncenter the sample object: # Getting the centered sample sample_centered &lt;- ans0$sample # Getting the observed statistics and turning it into a matrix so we can add it # to the samples observed &lt;- summary(ans0$formula) observed &lt;- matrix( observed, nrow = nrow(sample_centered[[1]]), ncol = length(observed), byrow = TRUE ) # Now we uncenter the sample sample_uncentered &lt;- lapply(sample_centered, function(x) { x + observed }) # We have to make it an mcmc.list object sample_uncentered &lt;- coda::mcmc.list(sample_uncentered) Under the hood: Empirical means and sd, and quantiles: summary(sample_uncentered) ## ## Iterations = 1769472:10944512 ## Thinning interval = 65536 ## Number of chains = 4 ## Sample size per chain = 141 ## ## 1.

Since we were running in parallel using four cores, the algorithm ran four chains of the MCMC algorithm. An eyeball test is to see if all the chains moved at about the same place; in such a case, we can start thinking about model convergence from the MCMC perspective. Once we are sure to have reach convergence on the MCMC algorithm, we can start thinking about how well does our model predicts the observed network’s proterties.

References "],["mathematical-interpretation.html", "6.7 Mathematical Interpretation", " 6.7 Mathematical Interpretation One of the most critical parts of statistical modeling is interpreting the results, if not the most important. In the case of ERGMs, a key aspect is based on change statistics. Suppose that we would like to know how likely the tie \\(y_{ij}\\) is to happen, given the rest of the network. We can compute such probabilities using what literature sometimes describes as the Gibbs-sampler. In particular, the log-odds of the \\(ij\\) tie ocurring conditional on the rest of the network can be written as: \\[\\begin{equation} \\mbox{logit}\\left({\\mathbb{P}\\left(y_{ij} = 1|y_{-ij}\\right) }\\right) = {\\theta}^\\mathbf{t}\\Delta\\delta\\left(y_{ij}:0\\to 1\\right), \\end{equation}\\] with \\(\\delta\\left(y_{ij}:0\\to 1\\right)\\equiv s\\left(\\mathbf{y}\\right)_{\\mbox{ij}}^+ - s\\left(\\mathbf{y}\\right)_{\\mbox{ij}}^-\\) as the vector of change statistics, in other words, the difference between the sufficient statistics when \\(y_{ij}=1\\) and its value when \\(y_{ij} = 0\\). To show this, we write the following: \\[\\begin{align*} {\\mathbb{P}\\left(y_{ij} = 1|y_{-ij}\\right) } &amp; = % \\frac{{\\mathbb{P}\\left(y_{ij} = 1, x_{-ij}\\right) }}{% {\\mathbb{P}\\left(y_{ij} = 1, y_{-ij}\\right) } + {\\mathbb{P}\\left(y_{ij} = 0, y_{-ij}\\right) }} \\\\ &amp; = \\frac{\\mbox{exp}\\left\\{{\\theta}^\\mathbf{t}s\\left(\\mathbf{y}\\right)^+_{ij}\\right\\}}{% \\mbox{exp}\\left\\{{\\theta}^\\mathbf{t}s\\left(\\mathbf{y}\\right)^+_{ij}\\right\\} + \\mbox{exp}\\left\\{{\\theta}^\\mathbf{t}s\\left(\\mathbf{y}\\right)^-_{ij}\\right\\}} \\end{align*}\\] Applying the logit function to the previous equation, we obtain: \\[\\begin{align*} &amp; = \\mbox{log}\\left\\{\\frac{\\mbox{exp}\\left\\{{\\theta}^\\mathbf{t}s\\left(\\mathbf{y}\\right)^+_{ij}\\right\\}}{% \\mbox{exp}\\left\\{{\\theta}^\\mathbf{t}s\\left(\\mathbf{y}\\right)^+_{ij}\\right\\} + % \\mbox{exp}\\left\\{{\\theta}^\\mathbf{t}s\\left(\\mathbf{y}\\right)^-_{ij}\\right\\}}\\right\\} - % \\mbox{log}\\left\\{ % \\frac{\\mbox{exp}\\left\\{{\\theta}^\\mathbf{t}s\\left(\\mathbf{y}\\right)^-_{ij}\\right\\}}{% \\mbox{exp}\\left\\{{\\theta}^\\mathbf{t}s\\left(\\mathbf{y}\\right)^+_{ij}\\right\\} + \\mbox{exp}\\left\\{{\\theta}^\\mathbf{t}s\\left(\\mathbf{y}\\right)^-_{ij}\\right\\}}% \\right\\} \\\\ &amp; = \\mbox{log}\\left\\{\\mbox{exp}\\left\\{{\\theta}^\\mathbf{t}s\\left(\\mathbf{y}\\right)^+_{ij}\\right\\}\\right\\} - \\mbox{log}\\left\\{\\mbox{exp}\\left\\{{\\theta}^\\mathbf{t}s\\left(\\mathbf{y}\\right)^-_{ij}\\right\\}\\right\\} \\\\ &amp; = {\\theta}^\\mathbf{t}\\left(s\\left(\\mathbf{y}\\right)^+_{ij} - s\\left(\\mathbf{y}\\right)^-_{ij}\\right) \\\\ &amp; = {\\theta}^\\mathbf{t}\\Delta\\delta\\left(y_{ij}:0\\to 1\\right) \\end{align*}\\] Henceforth, the conditional probability of node \\(n\\) gaining function \\(k\\) can be written as: \\[\\begin{equation} {\\mathbb{P}\\left(y_{ij} = 1|y_{-ij}\\right) } = \\frac{1}{1 + \\mbox{exp}\\left\\{-{\\theta}^\\mathbf{t}\\Delta\\delta\\left(y_{ij}:0\\to 1\\right)\\right\\}} \\end{equation}\\] i.e., a logistic probability. "],["markov-independence.html", "6.8 Markov independence", " 6.8 Markov independence The challenge of analyzing networks is their interdependent nature. Nonetheless, in the absence of such interdependence, ERGMs are equivalent to logistic regression. Conceptually, if all the statistics included in the model do not involve two or more dyads, then the model is non-Markovian in the sense of Markov graphs. Mathematically, to see this, it suffices to show that the ERGM probability can be written as the product of each dyads’ probabilities. \\[\\begin{equation*} {\\mathbb{P}\\left(\\mathbf{y} | \\theta\\right) } = \\frac{\\mbox{exp}\\left\\{{\\theta}^\\mathbf{t}s\\left(\\mathbf{y}\\right)\\right\\}}{\\sum_{y}\\mbox{exp}\\left\\{{\\theta}^\\mathbf{t}s\\left(\\mathbf{y}\\right)\\right\\}} = \\frac{\\prod_{ij}\\mbox{exp}\\left\\{{\\theta}^\\mathbf{t}s\\left(\\mathbf{y}\\right)_{ij}\\right\\}}{\\sum_{y}\\mbox{exp}\\left\\{{\\theta}^\\mathbf{t}s\\left(\\mathbf{y}\\right)\\right\\}} \\end{equation*}\\] Where \\(s\\left(\\right)_{ij}\\) is a function such that \\(s\\left(\\mathbf{y}\\right) = \\sum_{ij}{s\\left(\\mathbf{y}\\right)_{ij}}\\). We now need to deal with the normalizing constant. To see how that can be saparated, let’s start from the result: \\[\\begin{align*} &amp; =\\prod_{ij}\\left(1 + \\mbox{exp}\\left\\{{\\theta}^\\mathbf{t}s\\left(\\mathbf{y}\\right)_{ij}\\right\\}\\right) \\\\ &amp; = \\left(1 + \\mbox{exp}\\left\\{{\\theta}^\\mathbf{t}s\\left(\\mathbf{y}\\right)_{11}\\right\\}\\right)\\left(1 + \\mbox{exp}\\left\\{{\\theta}^\\mathbf{t}s\\left(\\mathbf{y}\\right)_{12}\\right\\}\\right)\\dots\\left(1 + \\mbox{exp}\\left\\{{\\theta}^\\mathbf{t}s\\left(\\mathbf{y}\\right)_{nn}\\right\\}\\right) \\\\ &amp; = 1 + \\mbox{exp}\\left\\{{\\theta}^\\mathbf{t}s\\left(\\mathbf{y}\\right)_{11}\\right\\} + \\mbox{exp}\\left\\{{\\theta}^\\mathbf{t}s\\left(\\mathbf{y}\\right)_{11}\\right\\}\\mbox{exp}\\left\\{{\\theta}^\\mathbf{t}s\\left(\\mathbf{y}\\right)_{12}\\right\\} + \\dots + \\prod_{ij}\\mbox{exp}\\left\\{{\\theta}^\\mathbf{t}s\\left(\\mathbf{y}\\right)_{ij}\\right\\} \\\\ &amp; = 1 + \\mbox{exp}\\left\\{{\\theta}^\\mathbf{t}s\\left(\\mathbf{y}\\right)_{11}\\right\\} + \\mbox{exp}\\left\\{{\\theta}^\\mathbf{t}\\left(s\\left(\\mathbf{y}\\right)_{11} + s\\left(\\mathbf{y}\\right)_{12}\\right)\\right\\} + \\dots + \\prod_{ij}\\mbox{exp}\\left\\{{\\theta}^\\mathbf{t}s\\left(\\mathbf{y}\\right)_{ij}\\right\\} \\\\ &amp; = \\sum_{\\mathbf{y}\\in\\mathcal{Y}}\\mbox{exp}\\left\\{{\\theta}^\\mathbf{t}s\\left(\\mathbf{y}\\right)\\right\\} \\end{align*}\\] Where the last equality follows from \\(s\\left(\\mathbf{y}\\right) = \\sum_{ij}{s\\left(\\mathbf{y}\\right)_{ij}}\\). This way, we can now write: \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{\\prod_{ij}\\mbox{exp}\\left\\{{\\theta}^\\mathbf{t}s\\left(\\mathbf{y}\\right)_{ij}\\right\\}}{\\sum_{y}\\mbox{exp}\\left\\{{\\theta}^\\mathbf{t}s\\left(\\mathbf{y}\\right)\\right\\}} = \\prod_{ij}\\frac{\\mbox{exp}\\left\\{{\\theta}^\\mathbf{t}s\\left(\\mathbf{y}\\right)_{ij}\\right\\}}{1 + \\mbox{exp}\\left\\{{\\theta}^\\mathbf{t}s\\left(\\mathbf{y}\\right)_{ij}\\right\\}} \\end{equation}\\] Related to this, block-diagonal ERGMs can be estimated as independent models, one per block. To see more about this, read (SNIJDERS 2010). Likewise, since independence depends–pun intended–on partitioning the objective function, as pointed by Snijders, non-linear functions make the model dependent, e.g., \\(s\\left(\\mathbf{y}\\right) = \\sqrt{\\sum_{ij}y_{ij}}\\), the square root of the edgecount is no longer a bernoulli graph. References "],["using-constraints-in-ergms.html", "Chapter 7 Using constraints in ERGMs", " Chapter 7 Using constraints in ERGMs Exponential Random Graph Models [ERGMs] can represent a variety of network classes. We often look at “regular” social networks like students in schools, colleagues in a workplace, or families. Nonetheless, some social networks we study have features that restrict how connections can occur. Typical examples are bi-partite graphs and multilevel networks. There are two classes of vertices in bi-partite networks, and ties can only occur between classes. On the other hand, Multilevel networks may feature multiple classes with inter-class ties somewhat restricted. In both cases, structural constraints exist, meaning that some configurations may not be plausible. Mathematically, what we are trying to do is, instead of assuming that all network configurations are possible: \\[ \\left\\{\\mathbf{y} \\in \\mathcal{Y}: y_{ij} = 0, \\forall i = j\\right\\} \\] we want to go a bit further avoiding loops, namely: \\[ \\left\\{\\mathbf{y} \\in \\mathcal{Y}: y_{ij} = 0, \\forall i = j; \\mathbf{y} \\in C\\right\\} \\], where \\(C\\) is a constraint, for example, only networks with no triangles. The ergm R package has built-in capabilities to deal with some of these cases. Nonetheless, we can specify models with arbitrary structural constraints built into the model. The key is in using offset terms. "],["example-1-interlocking-egos-and-disconnected-alters.html", "7.1 Example 1: Interlocking egos and disconnected alters", " 7.1 Example 1: Interlocking egos and disconnected alters Imagine that we have two sets of vertices. The first, group E, are egos part of an egocentric study. The second group, called A, is composed of people mentioned by egos in E but were not surveyed. Assume that individuals in A can only connect to individuals in E; moreover, individuals in E have no restrictions connecting to each other. In other words, only two types of ties exist: E-E and A-E. The question is now, how can we enforce such a constraint in an ERGM? Using offsets, and in particular, setting coefficients to -Inf provides an easy way to restrict the support set of ERGMs. For example, if we wanted to constrain the support to include networks with no triangles, we would add the term offset(triangle) and use the option offset.coef = -Inf to indicate that realizations including triangles are not possible. Using R: ergm(net ~ edges + offset(triangle), offset.coef = -Inf) In this model, a Bernoulli graph, we reduce the sample space to networks with no triangles. In our example, such statistic should only take non-zero values whenever ties within the A class happen. We can use the nodematch() term to do that. Formally \\[ \\text{NodeMatch}(x) = \\sum_{i,j} y_{ij} \\mathbf{1}({x_{i} = x_{j}}) \\] This statistic will sum over all ties in which source (\\(i\\)) and target (\\(j\\))’s \\(X\\) attribute is equal. One way to make this happen is by creating an auxiliary variable that equals, e.g., 0 for all vertices in A, and a unique value different from zero otherwise. For example, if we had 2 As and three Es, the data would look something like this: \\(\\{0,0,1,2,3\\}\\). The following code block creates an empty graph with 50 nodes, 10 of which are in group E (ego). library(ergm, quietly = TRUE) library(sna, quietly = TRUE) n &lt;- 50 n_egos &lt;- 10 net &lt;- as.network(matrix(0, ncol = n, nrow = n), directed = TRUE) # Let&#39;s assing the groups net %v% &quot;is.ego&quot; &lt;- c(rep(TRUE, n_egos), rep(FALSE, n - n_egos)) net %v% &quot;is.ego&quot; ## [1] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE FALSE FALSE ## [13] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ## [25] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ## [37] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ## [49] FALSE FALSE gplot(net, vertex.col = net %v% &quot;is.ego&quot;) To create the auxiliary variable, we will use the following function: # Function that creates an aux variable for the ergm model make_aux_var &lt;- function(my_net, is_ego_dummy) { n_vertex &lt;- length(my_net %v% is_ego_dummy) n_ego_ &lt;- sum(my_net %v% is_ego_dummy) # Creating an auxiliary variable to identify the non-informant non-informant ties my_net %v% &quot;aux_var&quot; &lt;- ifelse( !my_net %v% is_ego_dummy, 0, 1:(n_vertex - n_ego_) ) my_net } Calling the function in our data results in the following: net &lt;- make_aux_var(net, &quot;is.ego&quot;) # Taking a look over the first 15 rows of data cbind( Is_Ego = net %v% &quot;is.ego&quot;, Aux = net %v% &quot;aux_var&quot; ) |&gt; head(n = 15) ## Is_Ego Aux ## [1,] 1 1 ## [2,] 1 2 ## [3,] 1 3 ## [4,] 1 4 ## [5,] 1 5 ## [6,] 1 6 ## [7,] 1 7 ## [8,] 1 8 ## [9,] 1 9 ## [10,] 1 10 ## [11,] 0 0 ## [12,] 0 0 ## [13,] 0 0 ## [14,] 0 0 ## [15,] 0 0 We can now use this data to simulate a network in which ties between A-class vertices are not possible: set.seed(2828) net_sim &lt;- simulate(net ~ edges + nodematch(&quot;aux_var&quot;), coef = c(-3.0, -Inf)) gplot(net_sim, vertex.col = net_sim %v% &quot;is.ego&quot;) As you can see, this network has only ties of the type E-E and A-E. We can double-check by (i) looking at the counts and (ii) visualizing each induced-subgraph separately: summary(net_sim ~ edges + nodematch(&quot;aux_var&quot;)) ## edges nodematch.aux_var ## 49 0 net_of_alters &lt;- get.inducedSubgraph( net_sim, which((net_sim %v% &quot;aux_var&quot;) == 0) ) net_of_egos &lt;- get.inducedSubgraph( net_sim, which((net_sim %v% &quot;aux_var&quot;) != 0) ) # Counts summary(net_of_alters ~ edges + nodematch(&quot;aux_var&quot;)) ## edges nodematch.aux_var ## 0 0 summary(net_of_egos ~ edges + nodematch(&quot;aux_var&quot;)) ## edges nodematch.aux_var ## 1 0 # Figures op &lt;- par(mfcol = c(1, 2)) gplot(net_of_alters, vertex.col = net_of_alters %v% &quot;is.ego&quot;, main = &quot;A&quot;) gplot(net_of_egos, vertex.col = net_of_egos %v% &quot;is.ego&quot;, main = &quot;E&quot;) par(op) Now, to fit an ERGM with this constraint, we simply need to make use of the offset terms. Here is an example: ans &lt;- ergm( net_sim ~ edges + offset(nodematch(&quot;aux_var&quot;)), # The model (notice the offset) offset.coef = -Inf # The offset coefficient ) ## Starting maximum pseudolikelihood estimation (MPLE): ## Evaluating the predictor and response matrix. ## Maximizing the pseudolikelihood. ## Finished MPLE. ## Stopping at the initial estimate. ## Evaluating log-likelihood at the estimate. summary(ans) ## Call: ## ergm(formula = net_sim ~ edges + offset(nodematch(&quot;aux_var&quot;)), ## offset.coef = -Inf) ## ## Maximum Likelihood Results: ## ## Estimate Std.

To finalize, let’s look at a few simulations based on this model: set.seed(1323) op &lt;- par(mfcol = c(2,2), mar = rep(1, 4)) for (i in 1:4) { gplot(simulate(ans), vertex.col = net %v% &quot;is.ego&quot;, vertex.cex = 2) box() } par(op) All networks with no ties between A nodes. "],["example-2-bi-partite-networks.html", "7.2 Example 2: Bi-partite networks", " 7.2 Example 2: Bi-partite networks In the case of bipartite networks (sometimes called affiliation networks,) we can use ergm’s terms for bipartite graphs to corroborate what we discussed here. For example, the two-star term. Let’s start simulating a bipartite network using the edges and two-star parameters. Since the k-star term is usually complex to fit (tends to generate degenerate models,) we will take advantage of the Log() transformation function in the ergm package to smooth the term.11 The bipartite network that we will be simulating will have 100 actors and 50 entities. Actors, which we will map to the first level of the ergm terms, this is, b1star b1nodematch, etc. will send ties to the entities, the second level of the bipartite ERGM. To create a bipartite network, we will create an empty matrix of size nactors x nentitites; thus, actors are represented by rows and entities by columns. # Parameters for the simulation nactors &lt;- 100 nentities &lt;- floor(nactors/2) n &lt;- nactors + nentities # Creating an empty bipartite network (baseline) net_b &lt;- network( matrix(0, nrow = nactors, ncol = nentities), bipartite = TRUE ) # Simulating the bipartite ERGM, net_b &lt;- simulate(net_b ~ edges + Log(~b1star(2)), coef = c(-3, 1.5), seed = 55) Let’s see what we got here: summary(net_b ~ edges + Log(~b1star(2))) ## edges Log~b1star2 ## 245.000000 5.746203 netplot::nplot(net_b, vertex.col = (1:n &lt;= nactors) + 1) Notice that the first nactors vertices in the network are the actors, and the remaining are the entities. Now, although the ergm package features bipartite network terms, we can still fit a bipartite ERGM without explicitly declaring the graph as such. In such case, the b1star(2) term of a bipartite network is equivalent to an ostar(2) in a directed graph. Likewise, b2star(2) in a bipartite graph matches the istar(2) term in a directed graph. This information will be relevant when fitting the ERGM. Let’s transform the bipartite network into a directed graph. The following code block does so: # Identifying the edges net_not_b &lt;- which(as.matrix(net_b) != 0, arr.ind = TRUE) # We need to offset the endpoint of the ties by nactors # so that the ids go from 1 through (nactors + nentitites) net_not_b[,2] &lt;- net_not_b[,2] + nactors # The resulting graph is a directed network net_not_b &lt;- network(net_not_b, directed = TRUE) Now we are almost done. As before, we need to use node-level covariates to put the constraints in our model. For this ERGM to reflect an ERGM on a bipartite network, we need two constraints: Only ties from actors to entities are allowed, and entities can only receive ties. The corresponding offset terms for this model are: nodematch(\"is.actor\") ~ -Inf, and nodeocov(\"isnot.actor\") ~ -Inf. Mathematically: \\[\\begin{align*} \\text{NodeMatch(x = &quot;is.actor&quot;)} &amp;= \\sum_{i&lt;j} y_{ij}\\mathbb{1}\\left(x_i = x_j\\right) \\\\ \\text{NodeOCov(x = &quot;isnot.actor&quot;)} &amp;= \\sum_{i} x_i \\times \\sum_{j&lt;i} y_{ij} \\end{align*}\\] In other words, we are setting that ties between nodes of the same class are forbidden, and outgoing ties are forbidden for entities. Let’s create the vertex attributes needed to use the aforementioned terms: net_not_b %v% &quot;is.actor&quot; &lt;- as.integer(1:n &lt;= nactors) net_not_b %v% &quot;isnot.actor&quot; &lt;- as.integer(1:n &gt; nactors) Finally, to make sure we have done all well, let’s look how both networks–bipartite and unimodal–look side by side: # First, let&#39;s get the layout fig &lt;- netplot::nplot(net_b, vertex.col = (1:n &lt;= nactors) + 1) gridExtra::grid.arrange( fig, netplot::nplot( net_not_b, vertex.col = (1:n &lt;= nactors) + 1, layout = fig$.layout ), ncol = 2, nrow = 1 ) # Looking at the counts summary(net_b ~ edges + b1star(2) + b2star(2)) ## edges b1star2 b2star2 ## 245 313 645 summary(net_not_b ~ edges + ostar(2) + istar(2)) ## edges ostar2 istar2 ## 245 313 645 With the two networks matching, we can now fit the ERGMs with and without offset terms and compare the results between the two models: # ERGM with a bipartite graph res_b &lt;- ergm( # Main formula net_b ~ edges + Log(~b1star(2)), # Control parameters control = control.ergm(seed = 1) ) ## Warning: &#39;glpk&#39; selected as the solver, but package &#39;Rglpk&#39; is not available; ## falling back to &#39;lpSolveAPI&#39;.

The minor differences observed between the models are how the ergm package performs the sampling. In particular, in the bipartite case, ergm has special routines for making the sampling more efficient, having a higher acceptance rate than that of the model in which the bipartite graph was not explicitly declared. We can tell this by inspecting rejection rates: data.frame( Bipartite = coda::rejectionRate(res_b$sample[[1]]) * 100, Directed = coda::rejectionRate(res_not_b$sample[[1]][, -c(3,4)]) * 100 ) |&gt; knitr::kable(digits = 2, caption = &quot;Rejection rate (percent)&quot;) Table 7.1: Rejection rate (percent) Bipartite Directed edges 2.48 3.67 Log~b1star2 1.24 2.04 The ERGM fitted with the offset terms has a much higher rejection rate than that of the ERGM fitted with the bipartite ERGM. Finally, the fact that we can fit ERGMs using offset does not mean that we need to use it ALL the time. Unless there is a very good reason to go around ergm’s capabilities, I wouldn’t recommend fitting bipartite ERGMs as we just did, as the authors of the package have included (MANY) features to make our job easier. After writing this example, it became apparent the use of the Log() transformation function may not be ideal. Since many terms used in ERGMs can be zero, e.g., triangles, the term Log(~ ostar(2)) is undefined when ostar(2) = 0. In practice, the ERGM package sets a lower limit for the log of 0, so, instead of having Log(0) ~ -Inf, they set it to be a really large negative number. This causes all sorts of issues to the estimates; in our example, an over estimation of the population parameter and a positive log-likelihood. With that said, I wouldn’t recommend using this transformation too often.↩ "],["separable-temporal-exponential-family-random-graph-models.html", "Chapter 8 (Separable) Temporal Exponential Family Random Graph Models", " Chapter 8 (Separable) Temporal Exponential Family Random Graph Models This tutorial is great! https://statnet.org/trac/raw-attachment/wiki/Sunbelt2016/tergm_tutorial.pdf "],["simulating-and-visualizing-networks.html", "Chapter 9 Simulating and visualizing networks", " Chapter 9 Simulating and visualizing networks In this chapter, we will build and visualize artificial networks using Exponential Random Graph Models [ERGMs.] Together with chapter 3, this will be an extended example of how to read network data and visualize it using some of the available R packages out there.

"],["random-graph-models.html", "9.1 Random Graph Models", " 9.1 Random Graph Models While there are tons of social network data, we will use an artificial one for this chapter. We do this as it is always helpful to have more examples simulating Random networks. For this chapter, we will classify random graph models for sampling and generating networks into three categories: Exogenous: Graphs where the structure is determined by a macro rule, e.g., expected density, degree distribution, or degree-sequence. In these cases, ties are assigned to comply with a macro-property. Endogenous: This category includes all Random Graphs generated based on endogenous information, e.g., small-world, scale-free, etc. Here, a tie creation rule gives origin to a macro property, for example, preferential attachment in scale-free networks. Exponential Random Graph Models: Overall, since ERGMs compose a family of statistical models, we can always (or almost always) find a model specification that matches the previous categories. Whereas we are thinking about degree sequence, preferential attachment, or a mix of both, ERGMs can be the baseline for any of those models. The latter, ERGMs, are a generalization that covers all classes. Because of that, we will use ERGMs to generate our artificial network. "],["social-networks-in-schools.html", "9.2 Social Networks in Schools", " 9.2 Social Networks in Schools A common type of network we analyze is friendship networks. In this case, we will use ERGMs to simulate friendship networks within a school. In our simulated world, these networks will be dominated by the following phenomena Low density, Race homophily, Structural balance, And age homophily. If you have been paying attention to the previous chapters, you will notice that, out of these five properties, only one constitutes Markov graphs. Within a tie, homophily and density only depend on ego and alter. In race homophily, only ego and alter’s race matter for the tie formation, but, in the case of Structural balance, ego is more likely to befriend alter if a fried of ego is friends with alter, i.e., “the friend of my friend is my friend.” The simulation steps are as follows: Draw a population of \\(n\\) students and randomly distribute race and age across them. Create a network object. Simulate the ties in the empty network. Here is the code set.seed(712) n &lt;- 200 # Step 1: Students race &lt;- sample(c(&quot;white&quot;, &quot;non-white&quot;), n, replace = TRUE) age &lt;- sample(c(10, 14, 17), n, replace = TRUE) # Step 2: Create an empty network library(ergm) library(network) net &lt;- network.initialize(n) net %v% &quot;race&quot; &lt;- race net %v% &quot;age&quot; &lt;- age # Step 3: Simulate a graph net_sim &lt;- simulate( net ~ edges + nodematch(&quot;race&quot;) + ttriad + absdiff(&quot;age&quot;), coef = c(-4, .5, .25, -.5) ) What just happened? Here is a line-by-line breakout: set.seed(712) Since this is a random simulation, we need to fix a seed so it is reproducible. Otherwise, results would change with every iteration. n &lt;- 200 We are assigning the value 200 to the object n. This will make things easier as, if needed, changing the size of the networks can be done at the top of the code. race &lt;- sample(c(\"white\", \"non-white\"), n, replace = TRUE) We are sampling 200, or actually, n values from the vector c(\"white\", \"non-white\") with replacement. age &lt;- sample(c(10, 14, 17), n, replace = TRUE) Same as before, but with ages! library(ergm) Loading the ergm R package, which we need to simulate the networks! library(network) Loading the network R package, which we need to create the empty graph. net &lt;- network.initialize(n) Creating an empty graph of size n. net %v% \"race\" &lt;- race Using the %v% operator, we can access vertices features in the network object.

A couple of observations here: The LHS (left-hand-side) of the equation has the network, net The RHS (you guessed it) has the terms that govern the process. For low density, we used the edges term with a corresponding -4.0 for the parameter. For race homophily, we used the nodematch(\"race\") with a corresponding 0.5 parameter value. For structural balance, we use the ttriad term with parameter 0.25. For age homophily, we use the absdiff(\"age\") term with parameter -0.5. This is, in rigor, a term capturing heterophily. Nonetheless, heterophily is the opposite of homophily. Let’s take a quick look at the resulting graph library(sna) gplot(net_sim) We can now start to see whether we got what we wanted!

Many times you’ll find data in the form of an adjacency matrix. Other times, data will come in the form of an edgelist. Another common format is the adjacency list, which is a compressed version of an edgelist. Let’s see how the formats look like for the following network: example_graph &lt;- matrix(0L, 4, 4, dimnames = list(letters[1:4], letters[1:4])) example_graph[c(2, 7)] &lt;- 1L example_graph[&quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;] &lt;- 1L example_graph[&quot;d&quot;, &quot;c&quot;] &lt;- 1L example_graph &lt;- as.network(example_graph) set.seed(1231) gplot(example_graph, label = letters[1:4]) Adjacency matrix a matrix of size \\(n\\) by \\(n\\) where the \\(ij\\)-th entry represents the tie between \\(i\\) and \\(j\\). In a directed network, we say \\(i\\) connects to \\(j\\), so the \\(i\\)-th row shows the ties \\(i\\) sends to the rest of the network. Likewise, in a directed graph, the \\(j\\)-th column shows the ties sent to \\(j\\). For undirected graphs, the adjacency matrix is usually upper or lower diagonal. The adjacency matrix of an undirected graph is symmetric, so we don’t need to report the same information twice. For example: as.matrix(example_graph) ## a b c d ## a 0 0 0 0 ## b 1 0 0 0 ## c 0 1 0 1 ## d 0 0 1 0 Edge list a matrix of size \\(|E|\\) by \\(2\\), where \\(|E|\\) is the number of edges. Each entry represents a tie in the graph. as.edgelist(example_graph) ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] 2 1 ## [2,] 3 2 ## [3,] 3 4 ## [4,] 4 3 ## attr(,&quot;n&quot;) ## [1] 4 ## attr(,&quot;vnames&quot;) ## [1] &quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;c&quot; &quot;d&quot; ## attr(,&quot;directed&quot;) ## [1] TRUE ## attr(,&quot;bipartite&quot;) ## [1] FALSE ## attr(,&quot;loops&quot;) ## [1] FALSE ## attr(,&quot;class&quot;) ## [1] &quot;matrix_edgelist&quot; &quot;edgelist&quot; &quot;matrix&quot; &quot;array&quot; The command turns the network object into a matrix with a set of attributes (which are also printed.)

In plain text it would look something like this: 2 1 3 2 4 4 3 3 Here we will deal with an edgelist that includes node information. In my opinion, this is one of the best ways to share network data. Let’s read the data into R using the function read.csv: edges &lt;- read.csv(&quot;06-edgelist.csv&quot;) nodes &lt;- read.csv(&quot;06-nodes.csv&quot;) We now have two objects of class data.frame, edges and nodes. Let’s inspect them using the head function: head(edges) ## V1 V2 ## 1 2 7 ## 2 2 41 ## 3 3 5 ## 4 3 16 ## 5 4 138 ## 6 5 9 head(nodes) ## vertex.names race age ## 1 1 non-white 10 ## 2 2 white 10 ## 3 3 white 17 ## 4 4 non-white 14 ## 5 5 non-white 17 ## 6 6 non-white 14 It is always important to look at the data before creating the network. Most common errors happen before reading the data in and could go undetected in many cases. A few examples: Headers in the file could be treated as data, or the files may not have headers. Ego/alter columns may show in the wrong order. Both the igraph and network packages take the first and second columns of edgelists as ego and alter. Isolates, which wouldn’t show in the edgelist, may be missing from the node information set. This is one of the most common errors. Nodes showing in the edgelist may be missing from the nodelist. Both igraph and network have functions to read edgelist with a corresponding nodelist; the functions graph_from_data_frame and as.nework, respectively. Although , for both cases, you can avoid using a nodelist, it is highly recommended as then you will (a) make sure that isolates are included and (b) become aware of possible problems in the data. A frequent error in graph_from_data_frame is nodes present in the edgelist but not in the set of nodes. net_ig &lt;- igraph::graph_from_data_frame( d = edges, directed = TRUE, vertices = nodes ) Using as.network from the network package: net_net &lt;- network::as.network( x = edges, directed = TRUE, vertices = nodes ) As you can see, both syntaxes are very similar. The main point here is that the more explicit we are, the better. Nevertheless, R can be brilliant; being shy, i.e., not throwing warnings or errors, is not uncommon. In the next section, we will finally start visualizing the data. "],["visualizing-the-network.html", "9.4 Visualizing the network", " 9.4 Visualizing the network We will focus on three different attributes that we can use for this visualization: Node size, node shape, and node color. While there are no particular rules, some ideas you can follow are: Node size Use it to describe a continuous measurement. This feature is often used to highlight important nodes, e.g., using one of the many available degree measurements. Node shape Shapes can be used to represent categorical values. A good figure will not feature too many of them; less than four would make sense. Node color Like shapes, colors can be used to represent categorical values, so the same idea applies. Furthermore, it is not crazy to use both shape and color to represent the same feature. Notice that we have not talked about layout algorithms. The R packages to build graphs usually have internal rules to decide what algorithm to use. We will discuss that later on. Let’s start by size. 9.4.1 Vertex size Finding the right scale can be somewhat difficult. We will draw the graph four times to see what size would be the best: # Sized by indegree net_sim %v% &quot;indeg&quot; &lt;- sna::degree(net_sim, cmode = &quot;indegree&quot;) # Changing device config op &lt;- par(mfrow = c(2, 2), mai = c(.1, .1, .1, .1)) # Plotting glayout &lt;- gplot(net_sim, vertex.cex = (net_sim %v% &quot;indeg&quot;) * 2) gplot(net_sim, vertex.cex = net_sim %v% &quot;indeg&quot;, coord = glayout) gplot(net_sim, vertex.cex = (net_sim %v% &quot;indeg&quot;)/2, coord = glayout) gplot(net_sim, vertex.cex = (net_sim %v% &quot;indeg&quot;)/10, coord = glayout) # Restoring device config par(op) Line-by-line we did the following: net_sim %v% \"indeg\" &lt;- degree(net_sim, cmode = \"indegree\") Created a new vertex attribute called indegree and assigned it to the network object. The indegree is calculated using the degree function from the sna package. Since igraph also has a degree function, we are making sure that R uses sna’s and not igraph’s. The package::function notation is useful for these cases. op &lt;- par(mfrow = c(2, 2), mai = c(.1, .1, .1, .1)) This changes the graphical device information to (a) mfrow = c(2,2) have a 2x2 grid by row, meaning that new figures will be added left to right and then top to bottom, and (b) set the margins in the figure to be 0.1 inches in all four sizes. glayout &lt;- gplot(net_sim, vertex.cex = (net_sim %v% \"indeg\") * 2) generating the plot and recording the layout. The gplot function returns a matrix of size # vertices by 2 with the positions of the vertices. We are also passing the vertex.cex argument, which we use to specify the size of each vertex. In our case, we decided to size the vertices proportional to their indegree times two. gplot(net_sim, vertex.cex = net_sim %v% \"indeg\", coord = glayout), again, we are drawing the graph using the coordinates of the previous draw, but now the vertices are half the size of the original figure. The other two calls are similar to four. If we used igraph, setting the size can be more accessible thanks to the netdiffuseR R package. Let’s start by converting our network to an igraph object with the R package intergraph. library(intergraph) library(igraph) # Converting the network object to an igraph object net_sim_i &lt;- asIgraph(net_sim) # Plotting with igraph plot( net_sim_i, vertex.size = netdiffuseR::rescale_vertex_igraph( vertex.size = V(net_sim_i)$indeg, minmax.relative.size = c(.01, .1) ), layout = glayout, vertex.label = NA ) We could also have tried netplot, which should make things easier and make a better use of the space: library(netplot) nplot( net_sim, layout = glayout, vertex.color = &quot;tomato&quot;, vertex.frame.color = &quot;darkred&quot; ) With a good idea for size, we can now start looking into vertex color. 9.4.2 Vertex color For the color, we will use vertex age. Although age is, by definition, continuous, we only have three values for age. Because of this, we can treat age as categorical. Instead of using nplot we will go ahead with nplot_base. As of this version of the book, the netplot package does not have an easy way to add legends with the core function, nplot; therefore, we use nplot_base which is compatible with the R function legend, as we will now see: # Specifying colors for each vertex vcolors_palette &lt;- c(&quot;10&quot; = &quot;gray&quot;, &quot;14&quot; = &quot;tomato&quot;, &quot;17&quot; = &quot;steelblue&quot;) vcolors &lt;- vcolors_palette[as.character(net_sim %v% &quot;age&quot;)] net_sim %v% &quot;color&quot; &lt;- vcolors # Plotting nplot_base( net_ig, layout = glayout, vertex.color = net_sim %v% &quot;color&quot;, ) # Color legend legend( &quot;bottomright&quot;, legend = names(vcolors_palette), fill = vcolors_palette, bty = &quot;n&quot;, title = &quot;Age&quot; ) Line by line, this is what we just did: vcolors &lt;- c(\"10\" = \"gray\", \"14\" = \"tomato\", \"17\" = \"steelblue\") we created a character vector with three elements, \"gray\", \"tomato\", and \"blue\". Furthermore, the vector has names assigned to it, \"10\", \"14\", and \"17\"– the ages we have in the network–so that we can access its elements by indexing by name, e.g., if we type vcolors[\"10\"] R returns the value \"gray\". vcolors &lt;- vcolors[as.character(net_sim %v% \"age\")] there are several things going on in this line. First, we extract the attribute “age” from the network using the %v% operator. We then transform the resulting vector from integer type to a character type with the function as.character. Finally, using the resulting character vector with values \"10\", \"14\", \"17\", ..., we retrieve values from vcolors name-indexing. The resulting vector is of length equal to the vertex count in the network. net_sim %v% \"color\" &lt;- vcolors creates a new vertex attribute, color. The assigned value is the result from subsetting vcolors by the ages of each vertex. nplot_base(... finally draws the network. We pass the previously computed vertex coordinates and vertex colors with the new attribute color. legend(...) Let’s see one parameter at a time: \"bottomright\" tells the overall position of the legend legend = names(vcolors) passes the actual legend (text); in our case the ages of individuals. fill = vcolors passes the colors associated with the text. bty = \"n\" suppresses wrapping the legend within a box. title = \"Age\" sets the title to be “Age”. 9.4.3 Vertex shape For the color, we will use vertex age. Although age is, by definition, continuous, we only have three values for age. Because of this, we can treat age as categorical. # Specifying the shapes for each vertex vshape_list &lt;- c(&quot;white&quot; = 15, &quot;non-white&quot; = 3) vshape &lt;- vshape_list[as.character(net_sim %v% &quot;race&quot;)] net_sim %v% &quot;shape&quot; &lt;- vshape # Plotting nplot_base( net_ig, layout = glayout, vertex.color = net_sim %v% &quot;color&quot;, vertex.nsides = net_sim %v% &quot;shape&quot; ) # Color legend legend( &quot;bottomright&quot;, legend = names(vcolors_palette), fill = vcolors_palette, bty = &quot;n&quot;, title = &quot;Age&quot; ) # Shape legend legend( &quot;bottomleft&quot;, legend = names(vshape_list), pch = c(1, 2), bty = &quot;n&quot;, title = &quot;Race&quot; ) Let’s now compare the figure to our original ERGM: Low density (edges) Without low density, the figure would be a hairball. Race homophily (nodematch(\"race\")) Although not surprisingly evident, nodes tend to form small clusters by shape, which, in our model, represents race. Structural balance (ttriad) A force, in this case, opposite to low density, higher prevalence of transitive triads makes individuals cluster. Age homophily (absdiff(\"age\")) This is the most prominent feature of the graph. In it, nodes are clustered by age. Of the four features, age homophily is the one that stands out. Why is this tha case? If we look again at the parameters used in the ERGM and how these interact with vertices’ attributes, we will find the answer: The log-odds of a new race-homophilic tie are \\(1\\times\\theta_{\\mbox{race-homophily}} = 0.5\\). But, the log-odd of an age heterophilic tie between, say, 14 and 17 year olds is \\(|17-14|\\theta_{\\mbox{age-homophily}} = 3\\times -0.5 = -1.5\\). Therefore, the effect of heterophily (which is just the opposite of homophily) is significantly larger, actually three times in this case, than the race-homophily effect. This observation becomes clear if we run another simulation with the same seed, but adjusting for the maximum size the effect of age-homophily can take. A quick-n-dirty way to achieve this is to re-run the simulation with the nodematch term instead of the absdiff term. This way, we (a) explicitly operationalize the term as homophily (before it was heterophily,) and (b) have both homophily effects have the same influence in the model: net_sim2 &lt;- simulate( net ~ edges + nodematch(&quot;race&quot;) + ttriad + nodematch(&quot;age&quot;), coef = c(-5, .5, .25, .5) # This line changed ) Re-doing the plot. From the previous graph-drawing, only the graph structure changed. The vertex attributes are the same so we can go ahead and re-use them. Like I mentioned earlier, the nplot_base function currently supports igraph objects, so we will use intergraph::asIgraph to make it work: # Plotting nplot_base( asIgraph(net_sim2), # We comment this out to allow for a new layout # layout = glayout, vertex.color = net_sim %v% &quot;color&quot;, vertex.nsides = net_sim %v% &quot;shape&quot; ) # Color legend legend( &quot;bottomright&quot;, legend = names(vcolors_palette), fill = vcolors_palette, bty = &quot;n&quot;, title = &quot;Age&quot; ) # Shape legend legend( &quot;bottomleft&quot;, legend = names(vshape_list), pch = c(1, 2), bty = &quot;n&quot;, title = &quot;Race&quot; ) As expected, there is no longer a dominant effect in homophily. One important thing we can learn from this final example is that phenomena will not always show themselves in graph visualization. Careful analysis in complex networks is a must. "],["hypothesis-testing-in-networks.html", "Chapter 10 Hypothesis testing in networks", " Chapter 10 Hypothesis testing in networks Overall, there are many ways in which we can see hypothesis testing within the networks context: Comparing two or more networks, e.g., we want to see if the density of two networks are equal. Prevalence of a motif/pattern, e.g., check whether the observed number of transitive triads is different from that expected as of by chance. Multivariate using ERGMs, e.g., jointly test whether homophily and two stars are the motifs that drive network structure. The latter we already review in the ERGM chapter. In this part, we will look at types one and two; both using non-parametric methods. "],["comparing-networks.html", "10.1 Comparing networks", " 10.1 Comparing networks Imagine that we have two graphs, \\((G_1,G_2) \\in \\mathcal{G}\\), and we would like to assess whether a given statistic \\(s(\\cdot)\\), e.g., density, is equal in both of them. Formally, we would like to asses whether \\(H_0: s(G_1) - s(G_2) = k\\) vs \\(H_a: s(G_1) - s(G_2) \\neq k\\). As usual, the true distribution of \\(s(\\cdot)\\) is unknown, thus, one approach that we could use is a non-parametric bootstrap test. 10.1.1 Network bootstrap The non parametric bootstrap and jackknife methods for social networks were introduced by (Snijders and Borgatti 1999). The method itself is used to generate standard errors for network level statistics. Both methods are implemented in the R package netdiffuseR. 10.1.2 When the statistic is normal When the we deal with things that are normally distributed, e.g., sample means like density12, we can make use of the Student’s distribution for making inference. In particular, we can use Bootstrap/Jackknife to approximate the standard errors of the statistic for each network: Since \\(s(G_i)\\sim \\mbox{N}(\\mu_i,\\sigma_i^2/m_i)\\) for \\(i\\in\\{1,2\\}\\), in the case of the density, \\(m_i = n_i * (n_i - 1)\\). The statistic is then: \\[ s(G_1) - s(G_0)\\sim \\mbox{N}(\\mu_1-\\mu_0, \\sigma_1^2/m_1 + \\sigma_1^2/m_2) \\] Thus \\[ \\frac{s(G_1) - s(G_0) - \\mu_1 + \\mu_2}{\\sqrt{\\sigma_1^2/{m_1} + \\sigma_1^2/{m_2}}} \\sim t_{m_1 + m_2 - 2} \\] But, if we are testing \\(H_0: \\mu_1 - \\mu_2 = k\\), then, under the null \\[ \\frac{s(G_1) - s(G_0) - k}{\\sqrt{\\sigma_1^2/{m_1} + \\sigma_1^2/{m_2}}} \\sim t_{m_1 + m_2 - 2} \\] Where We now proceede to approximate the variances. Using the plugin principle (Efron and Tibshirani 1994), we can approximate the variances using Bootstrap/Jackknife, i.e., compute \\(\\hat\\sigma_1^2\\approx\\sigma_1^2/m_1\\) and \\(\\hat\\sigma_2^2\\approx\\sigma_2^2/m_2\\). Using netdiffuseR library(netdiffuseR) # Obtain a 100 replicates sg1 &lt;- bootnet(g1, function(i, ...) sum(i)/(nnodes(i) * (nnodes(i) - 1)), R = 100) sg2 &lt;- bootnet(g2, function(i, ...) sum(i)/(nnodes(i) * (nnodes(i) - 1)), R = 100) # Retrieving the variances hat_sigma1 &lt;- sg1$var_t hat_sigma2 &lt;- sg2$var_t # And the actual values sg1 &lt;- sg1$t0 sg2 &lt;- sg2$t0 With the approximates in hand, we can then use the the “t-test table” to retrieve the corresponding value, in R: # Building the statistic k &lt;- 0 # For equal variances tstat &lt;- (sg1 - sg2 - k)/(sqrt(hat_sigma1 + hat_sigma2)) # Computing the pvalue m1 &lt;- nnodes(g1)*(nnodes(g1) - 1) m2 &lt;- nnodes(g2)*(nnodes(g2) - 1) pt(tstat, df = m1 + m2 - 2) 10.1.3 When the statistic is NOT normal In the case that the statistic is not normally distributed, we cannot use the t-statistic any longer. Nevertheless, the Bootstrap can come to help. While in general it is better to use distributions of pivot statistics (see (Efron and Tibshirani 1994)), we can still leverage the power of this method to make inferences. For this example, \\(s(\\cdot)\\) will be the range of the threshold in a diffusion graph. As before, imagine that we are dealing with an statistic \\(s(\\cdot)\\) for two different networks, and we would like to asses whether we can reject \\(H_0\\) or fail to reject it. The procedure is very similar: One approach that we can test is whether \\(k \\in \\mbox{ConfInt}(s(G_1) - s(G_2))\\). Building confidence intervals with bootstrap could be more intuitive. Like before, we use bootstrap to generate a distribution of \\(s(G_1)\\) and \\(s(G_2)\\), in R: # Obtain a 1000 replicates sg1 &lt;- bootnet(g1, function(i, ...) range(threshold(i)), R = 1000) sg2 &lt;- bootnet(g2, function(i, ...) range(threshold(i)), R = 1000) # Retrieving the distributions sg1 &lt;- sg1$boot$t sg2 &lt;- sg2$boot$t # Define the statistic sdiff &lt;- sg1 - sg2 Once we have sdiff, we can proceed and compute the, for example, 95% confidence interval, and evaluate whether \\(k\\) falls within. In R: diff_ci &lt;- quantile(sdiff, probs = c(0.025, .975)) This corresponds to what Efron and Tibshirani call “percentile interval.” This is easy to compute, but a better approach is using the “BCa” method, “Bias Corrected and Accelerated.” (TBD) References "],["examples.html", "10.2 Examples", " 10.2 Examples 10.2.1 Average of node-level stats Supposed that we would like to compare something like average indegree. In particular, for both networks, \\(G_1\\) and \\(G_2\\), we compute the average indegree per node: \\[ s(G_1) = \\mbox{AvgIndeg}(G_1) = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i}\\sum_{j\\neq i}A^1_{ji} \\] where \\(A^1_{ji}\\) equals one if vertex \\(j\\) sends a tie to \\(i\\). In this case, since we are looking at an average, we have that \\(\\mbox{AvgIndeg}(G_1) \\sim N(\\mu_1, \\sigma^2_1/n)\\). Thus, taking advantage of the normality of the statistic, we can build a test statistic as follows: \\[ \\frac{s(G_1) - s(G_2) - k}{\\sqrt{\\hat\\sigma_{1}^2 + \\hat\\sigma_{2}^2}} \\sim t_{n_1 + n_2 - 2} \\] Where \\(\\hat\\sigma_i\\) is the bootstrap standard error, and \\(k = 0\\) when we are testing equality. This distributes \\(t\\) with \\(n_1+n_2-2\\) degrees of freedom. As a difference from the previous example using density, the degrees of freedom for this test are less as, instead of having an average across all entries of the adjacency matrix, we have an average across all vertices.

"],["statistical-inference.html", "11.4 Statistical inference", " 11.4 Statistical inference 11.4.1 Moran’s I Moran’s I tests for spatial autocorrelation. netdiffuseR implements the test in moran, which is suited for sparse matrices. We can use Moran’s I as a first look to whether there is something happening: let that be influence or homophily. 11.4.2 Using geodesics One approach is to use the geodesic (shortest path length) matrix to account for indirect influence. In the case of sparse matrices, and furthermore, in the presence of structural holes it is more convenient to calculate the distance matrix taking this into account. netdiffuseR has a function to do so, the approx_geodesic function, which, using graph powers, computes the shortest path up to n steps. This could be faster (if you only care up to n steps) than igraph or sns: # Extracting the large adjacency matrix (stacked) dgc &lt;- diag_expand(medInnovationsDiffNet$graph) ig &lt;- igraph::graph_from_adjacency_matrix(dgc) mat &lt;- network::as.network(as.matrix(dgc)) # Measuring times times &lt;- microbenchmark::microbenchmark( netdiffuseR = netdiffuseR::approx_geodesic(dgc), igraph = igraph::distances(ig), sna = sna::geodist(mat), times = 50, unit=&quot;ms&quot; ) The summary.diffnet method already runs Moran’s for you.

Included in the package, tests whether a particular network statistic depends on network structure Suitable to be applied to network thresholds (you can’t use thresholds in regression-like models!) 11.4.4 Idea Let \\(\\mathcal{G} = (V,E)\\) be a graph, \\(\\gamma\\) a vertex attribute, and \\(\\beta = f(\\gamma,\\mathcal{G})\\), then \\[\\gamma \\perp \\mathcal{G} \\implies \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\beta(\\gamma,\\mathcal{G})|\\mathcal{G}\\right] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\beta(\\gamma,\\mathcal{G})\\right]\\] This is, if for example time of adoption is independent on the structure of the network, then the average threshold level will be independent from the network structure as well. Another way of looking at this is that the test will allow us to see how probable is to have this combination of network structure and network threshold (if it is uncommon then we say that the diffusion model is highly likely) 11.4.4.1 Example Not random TOA To use this test, __netdiffuseR__ has the `struct_test` function.

In general, the big problem here is when we have a latent variable that co-determines both network and behavior. Unless we can control for such variable, regression analysis will be generically biased. On the other hand, if you can claim that either such variable doesn’t exist or you actually can control for it, then we have two options: lagged exposure models or contemporaneous exposure models. We will focus on the former. 11.4.5.1 Lagged exposure models In this type of model, we usually have the following \\[ y_t = f(W_{t-1}, y_{t-1}, X_i) + \\varepsilon \\] Furthermore, in the case of adoption, we have \\[ y_{it} = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} 1 &amp; \\mbox{if}\\quad \\rho\\sum_{j\\neq i}\\frac{W_{ijt-1}y_{it-1}}{\\sum_{j\\neq i}W_{ijt-1}} + X_{it}\\beta &gt; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; \\mbox{otherwise} \\end{array} \\right. \\] In netdiffuseR is as easy as doing the following: # fakedata set.seed(121) W &lt;- rgraph_ws(1e3, 8, .2) X &lt;- cbind(var1 = rnorm(1e3)) toa &lt;- sample(c(NA,1:5), 1e3, TRUE) dn &lt;- new_diffnet(W, toa=toa, vertex.static.attrs = X) ## Warning in new_diffnet(W, toa = toa, vertex.static.attrs = X): -graph- is static ## and will be recycled (see ?new_diffnet). # Computing exposure and adoption for regression dn[[&quot;cohesive_expo&quot;]] &lt;- cbind(NA, exposure(dn)[,-nslices(dn)]) dn[[&quot;adopt&quot;]] &lt;- dn$cumadopt # Generating the data and running the model dat &lt;- as.data.frame(dn) ans &lt;- glm(adopt ~ cohesive_expo + var1 + factor(per), data = dat, family = binomial(link=&quot;probit&quot;), subset = is.na(toa) | (per &lt;= toa)) summary(ans) ## ## Call: ## glm(formula = adopt ~ cohesive_expo + var1 + factor(per), family = binomial(link = &quot;probit&quot;), ## data = dat, subset = is.na(toa) | (per &lt;= toa)) ## ## Deviance Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -1.1754 -0.8462 -0.6645 1.2878 1.9523 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

Two alternatives to solve this: Using Instrumental Variables Probit (ivprobit in both R and Stata) Use a Spatial Autoregressive (SAR) Probit (SpatialProbit and ProbitSpatial in R). We won’t cover these here. 11.4.6 Problems Using the dataset stats.rda: Compute Moran’s I as the function summary.diffnet does. For this you’ll need to use the function toa_mat (which calculates the cumulative adoption matrix), and approx_geodesic (which computes the geodesic matrix). (see ?summary.diffnet for more details). Read the data as diffnet object, and fit the following logit model \\(adopt = Exposure*\\gamma + Measure*\\beta + \\varepsilon\\). What happens if you exclude the time-fixed effects?

In economics, this problem, which they call the “spillover effect,” is actively studied. For the power calculation, we will assume that alters only get exposed if egos acquire the behavior. Furthermore, for this first run, we will assume that there is no social reinforcement or influence between alters. We will later relax this assumption. To calculate power we will do the following: Simulate egos’ behavior following a logit distribution. Randomly drop some egos as a result of attrition. Simulate alters’ behavior using their egos as the treatment. Fit a logistic regression based on the previous model. Accept/reject the null and store the result. The previous steps will be repeated 500 for each value of \\(n\\) we analyze. We will finalize by plotting power against sample sizes. Let’s first start by writing down the simulation parameters: # Design n_sims &lt;- 1000 # Number of simulations n_a &lt;- 4 # Number of alters sizes &lt;- # Sizes to try seq(from = 100, to = 250, by = 25) # Assumptions odds_h_1 &lt;- 2.0 # Odds of Increase/ attrition &lt;- .3 baseline &lt;- .2 # Low prevalence in 1s # Parameters alpha &lt;- .05 beta_pow &lt;- 0.2 As we discuss in 16, it is always a good idea to encapsule the simulation into a function: # The odds turned to a prob theta_h_1 &lt;- plogis(log(odds_h_1)) # Simulation function sim_data &lt;- function(n) { # Treatment assignment tr &lt;- c(rep(1, n/2), rep(0, n/2)) # Step 1: Sampling population of egos y_ego &lt;- runif(n) &lt; c( rep(theta_h_1, n/2), rep(0.5, n/2) ) # Step 2: Simulating attrition todrop &lt;- order(runif(n))[1:(n * attrition)] y_ego &lt;- y_ego[-todrop] tr &lt;- tr[-todrop] n &lt;- n - length(todrop) # Step 3: Simulating alter&#39;s effect. We assume the same as in # ego tr_alter &lt;- rep(y_ego * tr, n_a) y_alter &lt;- runif(n * n_a) &lt; ifelse(tr_alter, theta_h_1, 0.5) # Step 4: Computing test statistic res_ego &lt;- tryCatch(glm(y_ego ~ tr, family = binomial(&quot;logit&quot;)), error = function(e) e) res_alter &lt;- tryCatch(glm(y_alter ~ tr_alter, family = binomial(&quot;logit&quot;)), error = function(e) e) if (inherits(res_ego, &quot;error&quot;) | inherits(res_alter, &quot;error&quot;)) return(c(ego = NA, alter = NA)) # Step 5: Reject? c( ego = summary(res_ego)$coefficients[&quot;tr&quot;, &quot;Pr(&gt;|z|)&quot;] &lt; alpha, alter = summary(res_alter)$coefficients[&quot;tr_alter&quot;, &quot;Pr(&gt;|z|)&quot;] &lt; alpha ) } Now that we have the data generating function, we can run the simulations to approximate statistical power given the sample size.

The results will be stored in the matrix spower. # We always set the seed set.seed(88) # Making space, and running! spower &lt;- NULL for (s in sizes) { # Run the simulation for size s simres &lt;- rowMeans(replicate(n_sims, sim_data(s)), na.rm = TRUE) # And store the results spower &lt;- rbind(spower, simres) } The following figure shows the approximate power for finding effects at both levels, ego and alter: library(ggplot2) spower &lt;- rbind( data.frame(size = sizes, power = spower[,&quot;ego&quot;], type = &quot;ego&quot;), data.frame(size = sizes, power = spower[,&quot;alter&quot;], type = &quot;alter&quot;) ) spower |&gt; ggplot(aes(x = size, y = power, colour = type)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = &quot;loess&quot;, formula = y ~ x) + labs(x = &quot;Number of Egos&quot;, y = &quot;Approx.

Instead of having a treated and control group, we have a single group over which we will measure behavioral change. We will simulate individuals in their initial state, still 0/1, and then simulate that the intervention will make them more likely to have \\(y = 1.\\) We will also assume that subjects generally don’t change their behavior and that the baseline prevalence of zeros is higher. The simulation steps are as follows: For each individual in the population, draw the underlaying probability that \\(y = 1\\). With that probability assign the value of \\(y\\).

With it, we can reformulate inferential problems by writing probabilities in terms of known quantities. Bayes’ rule can be stated as follows: \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathbb{P}{\\left(X=x|Y=y\\right)} = \\frac{\\mathbb{P}{\\left(Y=y|X=y\\right)}\\mathbb{P}{\\left(X=x\\right)}}{\\mathbb{P}{\\left(Y=y\\right)}} \\end{equation}\\] Here we say that the conditional probability of \\(X\\) given \\(Y\\) can be expressed in terms of the conditional probability of \\(Y\\) given \\(X\\). For example, let \\(X\\) be an unknown vector of parameters \\(\\theta\\in\\Theta\\) and \\(Y\\) a dataset \\(D \\sim f(\\theta)\\) whose data generating process depends on the unobserved \\(\\theta\\). As the posterior distribution of model parameters is in general elusive, instead, we use Bayes’ rule to rephrase the problem: \\[\\begin{equation*} \\mathbb{P}{\\left(\\theta|D\\right)} = \\frac{\\mathbb{P}{\\left(\\theta|D\\right)}\\mathbb{P}{\\left(\\theta\\right)}}{\\mathbb{P}{\\left(D\\right)}} \\end{equation*}\\] Since the denominator of the equation does not depend on \\(\\theta\\), we can, instead, write \\[\\begin{equation*} \\mathbb{P}{\\left(\\theta|D\\right)} \\propto \\mathbb{P}{\\left(\\theta|D\\right)}\\mathbb{P}{\\left(\\theta\\right)} \\end{equation*}\\] In the Bayesian world, the unconditional distribution of the model parameters is assumed to come from a particular distribution, whereas in the frequentist world, no distributional assumptions are made about the model parameters. The latter is then equivalent to saying that \\(\\theta\\sim \\mbox{Uniform}(-\\infty, +\\infty)\\); therefore, even frequentists assume something about the model parameters!14 Bayes’ rule can be derived using conditional probabilities. In particular, \\(\\mathbb{P}{\\left(x=x|Y=y\\right)}\\) is defined as \\(\\mathbb{P}{\\left(x=x, Y=y\\right)}/Pr{\\left(Y=y\\right)}\\). Likewise, \\(\\mathbb{P}{\\left(y=y|X=x\\right)}\\) is defined as \\(\\mathbb{P}{\\left(y=y, X=x\\right)}/Pr{\\left(X=x\\right)}\\), which can be re-written as \\(\\mathbb{P}{\\left(x=x, Y=y\\right)} = \\mathbb{P}{\\left(y=y|X=x\\right)}Pr{\\left(X=x\\right)}\\). Replacing the last equality in the first equation we get \\[\\begin{align*} \\mathbb{P}{\\left(x=x|Y=y\\right)} &amp; = \\frac{\\mathbb{P}{\\left(x=x, Y=y\\right)}}{Pr{\\left(Y=y\\right)}} \\\\ &amp; \\frac{\\mathbb{P}{\\left(y=y|X=x\\right)}Pr{\\left(X=x\\right)}}{Pr{\\left(Y=y\\right)}} \\end{align*}\\] The discussion about differences and similarities between frequentists and Bayesians has a long tradition. Bottom line, no one can say 100% that they are either-or.

We can prove convergence by showing that (a) the sequence is ergodic, and (b) the posterior distribution matches the target distribution. Ergodicity describes three propoerties of a chain: Irreducibility: There is no zero probability of transitioning between any pair of states. Aperiodicity: As the term suggests, the chain has no repetitive periods/sequences. Non-transient: Transient refers to a chain having non-zero probability of never returning to a starting state. The three properties are reached by any random walk based on a well-defined probability distribution, so we will focus on showing that the posterior matches the target distribution.

"],["example-1-sample-size-for-a-proportion.html", "16.2 Example 1: Sample size for a proportion", " 16.2 Example 1: Sample size for a proportion Let’s imagine we are preparing a study in which we would like to estimate the proportion of individuals with a given status. Formally, we then say that the variable \\(Y\\sim\\mbox{Bernoulli}(p)\\). To do so, we will need to survey \\(n\\) individuals and estimate such a number by taking the sample average. Furthermore, we hypothesize that under the null the proportion is \\(H_0: p = p_0\\). The key here is to think about a simple rejection rule. Again, power is the probability of rejecting the null given that the alternative is true. So, to write down the equation, we need to think about acceptance and rejection regions. Let \\(\\hat p\\) be our estimate for the population parameter, furthermore, \\(\\hat p = n^{-1}\\sum_i y_i\\). Our test statistic can be–and will be, most of the cases–standardized to leverage the law of large numbers; under the null, we write the following: \\[\\begin{align*} \\mathbb{E}(\\hat p) &amp; = p_0 \\\\ \\mathbf{Var}(\\hat p) &amp; = \\sqrt{p_0(1-p_0)/n} \\end{align*}\\] Therefore, the statistic: \\[\\begin{equation*} \\frac{\\hat p - p_0}{\\sqrt{p_0(1-p_0)/n}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{n}(\\hat p - p_0)}{\\sqrt{p_0(1-p_0)}} \\sim \\mbox{N}(0, 1) \\end{equation*}\\] Since the statistic is normally distributed, we can then say when we will reject the null. For this case, that depends on the critical value, which most of the time is defined in terms of the type I error rate. Formally, we reject the null if \\[\\begin{equation*} \\frac{\\sqrt{n}(\\hat p - p_0)}{\\sqrt{p_0(1-p_0)}} &gt; Z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\end{equation*}\\] This is equivalent to saying that the test statistic fell into the rejection region. With this in hand, we can now write out the equation that we will be using for calculating the sample size. Going back to the definition of power: \\[\\begin{align*} \\mathbb{P}{(\\mbox{Reject H0}|\\mbox{H1 is true})} &amp; = 1-\\beta \\\\ \\mathbb{P}{\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{n}(\\hat p - p_0)}{\\sqrt{p_0(1-p_0)}} &gt; Z_{1-\\alpha/2}\\right.\\left|\\vphantom{\\frac{1}{2}}p = p_1\\right)} &amp; = 1 - \\beta \\end{align*}\\] Observe that we cannot compute the power for all \\(p\\neq p_0\\); instead, we look at a given parameter value. A good idea is to start from one previously known or identified in other studies. The key idea here is to be able to manipulate the argument of the probability to turn it into a known distribution, for example, the normal distribution: For a given Type I of 0.05 and power of 0.8, the required sample size can be computed as follows: \\[\\begin{align*} 1 - \\beta &amp; = \\mathbb{P}{\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{n}(\\hat p - p_0)}{\\sqrt{p_0(1-p_0)}} &gt; Z_{1-\\alpha/2}\\right.\\left|\\vphantom{\\frac{1}{2}}p = p_1\\right)} \\\\ &amp; = \\mathbb{P}{\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{n}(\\hat p - p_0)}{\\sqrt{p_0(1-p_0)}} &lt; Z_{\\alpha/2}\\right.\\left|\\vphantom{\\frac{1}{2}}p = p_1\\right)} \\\\ &amp; = \\mathbb{P}{\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{n}(\\hat p - p_0)}{\\sqrt{p_1(1-p_1)}} &lt; \\frac{Z_{\\alpha/2}\\sqrt{p_0(1-p_0)}}{\\sqrt{p_1(1-p_1)}}\\right.\\left|\\vphantom{\\frac{1}{2}}p = p_1\\right)} \\\\ &amp; = \\mathbb{P}{\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{n}(\\hat p - p_0 + p_0 - p_1)}{\\sqrt{p_1(1-p_1)}} &lt; \\frac{Z_{\\alpha/2}\\sqrt{p_0(1-p_0)} + \\sqrt{n}(p_0 - p_1)}{\\sqrt{p_1(1-p_1)}}\\right.\\left|\\vphantom{\\frac{1}{2}}p = p_1\\right)} \\\\ &amp; = \\mathbb{P}{\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{n}(\\hat p - p_1)}{\\sqrt{p_1(1-p_1)}} &lt; \\frac{Z_{\\alpha/2}\\sqrt{p_0(1-p_0)} + \\sqrt{n}(p_0 - p_1)}{\\sqrt{p_1(1-p_1)}}\\right.\\left|\\vphantom{\\frac{1}{2}}p = p_1\\right)} \\\\ &amp; = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{Z_{\\alpha/2}\\sqrt{p_0(1-p_0)} + \\sqrt{n}(p_0 - p_1)}{\\sqrt{p_1(1-p_1)}}\\right.\\left|\\vphantom{\\frac{1}{2}}p = p_1\\right) \\\\ \\end{align*}\\] The last equality follows from the quantity \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{n}(\\hat p - p_1)}{\\sqrt{p_1(1-p_1)}}\\) distributing standard normal. We can now take the inverse of the cumulative distribution function (cdf) to isolate the sample size \\(n\\): \\[\\begin{align*} \\Phi^{-1}(1 - \\beta)&amp; = \\frac{Z_{\\alpha/2}\\sqrt{p_0(1-p_0)} + \\sqrt{n}(p_0 - p_1)}{\\sqrt{p_1(1-p_1)}} \\\\ Z_{1-\\beta}\\sqrt{p_1(1-p_1)}&amp; = Z_{\\alpha/2}\\sqrt{p_0(1-p_0)} + \\sqrt{n}(p_0 - p_1) \\\\ \\frac{\\left(Z_{1-\\beta}\\sqrt{p_1(1-p_1)} - Z_{\\alpha/2}\\sqrt{p_0(1-p_0)}\\right)^2}{(p_0 - p_1)^2}&amp; = n \\\\ \\end{align*}\\] Therefore, for the parameters \\((1-\\beta, \\alpha, p_0, p_1) = (0.8, 0.05, 0.5, 0.6)\\), the required sample size is 193.8473 \\(\\sim\\) 194.

If analytical solutions are not available, simulations can be an excellent alternative to save the day. Let’s re-do the sample size calculation using simulations. The procedure to compute sample size based on simulations is computationally intensive. The concept is straightforward, pick a set of best guesses for sample size, and for each one of them, simulate the system to estimate power. Now, for a given value of \\(n\\), we: Simulate a sample of size \\(n\\) under the alternative. Compute the test statistic corresponding to the null. Accept or reject accordingly to the selected \\(\\alpha\\), and store the result. Repeat steps 1-3 many times. The obtained average is the corresponding power.

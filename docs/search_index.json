Nonetheless, the “language barrier” we may face when communicating with our fellow scientists, many of the methods developed to study specific types of problems can indeed be helpful outside of their original context. This project began as a part of a workshop that took place at USC’s Center for Applied Network Analysis. Now, it is a personal project that I use to gather and study statistical methods used for analyzing networks, emphasizing social and biological systems. Moreover, the book will use statistical computing methods as a core component when developing these topics. In general, we will, besides R itself, we will be using R studio and the following R packages: dplyr for data management, stringr for data cleaning, and of course igraph, netdiffuseR (a bit of a bias here), and statnet for our neat network analysis.1 You can access the book’s source code at https://github.com/gvegayon/appliedsnar. Some of you may be wondering “what about ggplot2 and friends? What about tidyverse,” well, my short answer is I jumped into R before all of that was that popular. When I started, plots were all about lattice, and after a couple of years on that, about base R graphics. What I’m saying is that so far, I have not found a compelling reason to leave my “old practices” and embrace all the tidyverse movement (religion?).↩︎ "],["the-author.html", "1.2 The author", " 1.2 The author I am a Research Programmer at USC’s Department of Population and Public Health Sciences, where I work on studying Complex Systems using Statistical Computing.

"],["introduction.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction", " Chapter 2 Introduction Social Network Analysis and Network Science, have a long scholarly tradition. From social diffusion models to protein-interaction networks, these complex-systems disciplines cover a wide range of problems across scientific fields. Yet, although these could be seen as wildly different, the object under the microscope is the same, networks. With a long history (and insufficient levels of inter-discipline collaboration, if you allow me to say) of scientific advances happing in a somewhat isolated fashion, the potential of cross-pollination between disciplines within network science is immense. This book is an attempt to compile the many methods available in the realm of complexity sciences, provide an in-depth mathematical examination–when possible–, and provide a few examples illustrating their usage.

For example, if you want to read the manual (help file) of the read.csv function, you can type either of these: r ?read.csv ?\"read.csv\" help(read.csv) help(\"read.csv\") If you are not fully aware of what is the name of the function, you can always use the fuzzy search r help.search(\"linear regression\") ??\"linear regression\" In R you can create new objects by either using the assign operator (&lt;-) or the equal sign =, for example, the following 2 are equivalent: r a &lt;- 1 a = 1 Historically the assign operator is the most common used. R has several type of objects, the most basic structures in R are vectors, matrix, list, data.frame.

In general, distribution functions have the following name structure: Random Number Generation: r[name-of-the-distribution], e.g. rnorm for normal, runif for uniform. Density function: d[name-of-the-distribution], e.g. dnorm for normal, dunif for uniform. Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF): p[name-of-the-distribution], e.g. pnorm for normal, punif for uniform. Inverse (quantile) function: q[name-of-the-distribution], e.g. qnorm for the normal, qunif for the uniform. Here are some examples: # To ensure reproducibility set.seed(1231) # 100,000 Unif(0,1) numbers x &lt;- runif(1e5) hist(x) # 100,000 N(0,1) numbers x &lt;- rnorm(1e5) hist(x) # 100,000 N(10,25) numbers x &lt;- rnorm(1e5, mean = 10, sd = 5) hist(x) # 100,000 Poisson(5) numbers x &lt;- rpois(1e5, lambda = 5) hist(x) # 100,000 rexp(5) numbers x &lt;- rexp(1e5, 5) hist(x) More distributions available at ??Distributions.

In this case, since both variables are numeric, a good way of doing it is to encode the id such that, for example, the last three x numbers are the photoid and the first ones are the school id. To do this we need to take into account the range of the variables. Here, photoid has the following range: (photo_id_ran &lt;- range(dat$photoid)) ## [1] 1 2074 As the variable spans up to 2074, we need to set the last 4 units of the variable to store the photoid. We will use dplyr (Wickham et al. 2017) and magrittr (Bache and Wickham 2014)] (the pipe operator, %&gt;%) to create this variable, and we will call it… id (mind blowing, right?): library(dplyr) ## ## Attaching package: &#39;dplyr&#39; ## The following objects are masked from &#39;package:stats&#39;: ## ## filter, lag ## The following objects are masked from &#39;package:base&#39;: ## ## intersect, setdiff, setequal, union library(magrittr) (dat %&lt;&gt;% mutate(id = school*10000 + photoid)) %&gt;% head %&gt;% select(school, photoid, id) ## school photoid id ## 1 111 1 1110001 ## 2 111 2 1110002 ## 3 111 7 1110007 ## 4 111 13 1110013 ## 5 111 14 1110014 ## 6 111 15 1110015 Wow, what happend in the last three lines of code! What is that %&gt;%? Well, that’s the piping operator, and it is a very nice way of writing nested function calls.

This allows us to select all variables that starts with the word “sch_friend,” which means that sch_friend11, sch_friend12, ... will all be selected. dat %&gt;% select(id, school, starts_with(&quot;sch_friend&quot;)) ## # A tibble: 2,164 x 78 ## id school sch_friend11 sch_friend12 sch_friend13 sch_friend14 ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 1110001 111 NA NA NA NA ## 2 1110002 111 424 423 426 289 ## 3 1110007 111 629 505 NA NA ## 4 1110013 111 232 569 NA NA ## 5 1110014 111 582 134 41 592 ## 6 1110015 111 26 488 81 138 ## 7 1110020 111 528 NA 492 395 ## 8 1110022 111 NA NA NA NA ## 9 1110025 111 135 185 553 84 ## 10 1110027 111 346 168 559 5 ## # … with 2,154 more rows, and 72 more variables: sch_friend15 &lt;int&gt;, ## # sch_friend16 &lt;int&gt;, sch_friend17 &lt;int&gt;, sch_friend18 &lt;int&gt;, ## # sch_friend19 &lt;int&gt;, sch_friend110 &lt;int&gt;, sch_friend111 &lt;int&gt;, ## # sch_friend112 &lt;int&gt;, sch_friend113 &lt;int&gt;, sch_friend114 &lt;int&gt;, ## # sch_friend115 &lt;int&gt;, sch_friend116 &lt;int&gt;, sch_friend117 &lt;int&gt;, ## # sch_friend118 &lt;int&gt;, sch_friend119 &lt;int&gt;, sch_friend21 &lt;int&gt;, ## # sch_friend22 &lt;int&gt;, sch_friend23 &lt;int&gt;, sch_friend24 &lt;int&gt;, ## # sch_friend25 &lt;int&gt;, sch_friend26 &lt;int&gt;, sch_friend27 &lt;int&gt;, ## # sch_friend28 &lt;int&gt;, sch_friend29 &lt;int&gt;, sch_friend210 &lt;int&gt;, ## # sch_friend211 &lt;int&gt;, sch_friend212 &lt;int&gt;, sch_friend213 &lt;int&gt;, ## # sch_friend214 &lt;int&gt;, sch_friend215 &lt;int&gt;, sch_friend216 &lt;int&gt;, ## # sch_friend217 &lt;int&gt;, sch_friend218 &lt;int&gt;, sch_friend219 &lt;int&gt;, ## # sch_friend31 &lt;int&gt;, sch_friend32 &lt;int&gt;, sch_friend33 &lt;int&gt;, ## # sch_friend34 &lt;int&gt;, sch_friend35 &lt;int&gt;, sch_friend36 &lt;int&gt;, ## # sch_friend37 &lt;int&gt;, sch_friend38 &lt;int&gt;, sch_friend39 &lt;int&gt;, ## # sch_friend310 &lt;int&gt;, sch_friend311 &lt;int&gt;, sch_friend312 &lt;int&gt;, ## # sch_friend313 &lt;int&gt;, sch_friend314 &lt;int&gt;, sch_friend315 &lt;int&gt;, ## # sch_friend316 &lt;int&gt;, sch_friend317 &lt;int&gt;, sch_friend318 &lt;int&gt;, ## # sch_friend319 &lt;int&gt;, sch_friend41 &lt;int&gt;, sch_friend42 &lt;int&gt;, ## # sch_friend43 &lt;int&gt;, sch_friend44 &lt;int&gt;, sch_friend45 &lt;int&gt;, ## # sch_friend46 &lt;int&gt;, sch_friend47 &lt;int&gt;, sch_friend48 &lt;int&gt;, ## # sch_friend49 &lt;int&gt;, sch_friend410 &lt;int&gt;, sch_friend411 &lt;int&gt;, ## # sch_friend412 &lt;int&gt;, sch_friend413 &lt;int&gt;, sch_friend414 &lt;int&gt;, ## # sch_friend415 &lt;int&gt;, sch_friend416 &lt;int&gt;, sch_friend417 &lt;int&gt;, ## # sch_friend418 &lt;int&gt;, sch_friend419 &lt;int&gt; Then, we reshape it to long format: By transposing all the sch_friend* to long. We do this by means of the function gather (from the tidyr package). This is an alternative to the reshape function, and I personally find it easier to use. Let’s see how it works: dat %&gt;% select(id, school, starts_with(&quot;sch_friend&quot;)) %&gt;% gather(key = &quot;varname&quot;, value = &quot;content&quot;, -id, -school) ## # A tibble: 164,464 x 4 ## id school varname content ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 1110001 111 sch_friend11 NA ## 2 1110002 111 sch_friend11 424 ## 3 1110007 111 sch_friend11 629 ## 4 1110013 111 sch_friend11 232 ## 5 1110014 111 sch_friend11 582 ## 6 1110015 111 sch_friend11 26 ## 7 1110020 111 sch_friend11 528 ## 8 1110022 111 sch_friend11 NA ## 9 1110025 111 sch_friend11 135 ## 10 1110027 111 sch_friend11 346 ## # … with 164,454 more rows In this case the key parameter sets the name of the variable that will contain the name of the variable that was reshaped, while value is the name of the variable that will hold the content of the data (that’s why I named those like that). The -id, -school bit tells the function to “drop” those variables before reshaping, in other words, “reshape everything but id and school.” Also, notice that we passed from 2164 rows to 19 (nominations) * 2164 (subjects) * 4 (waves) = 164464 rows, as expected. As the nomination data can be empty for some cells, we need to take care of those cases, the NAs, so we filter the data: dat %&gt;% select(id, school, starts_with(&quot;sch_friend&quot;)) %&gt;% gather(key = &quot;varname&quot;, value = &quot;content&quot;, -id, -school) %&gt;% filter(!is.na(content)) ## # A tibble: 39,561 x 4 ## id school varname content ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 1110002 111 sch_friend11 424 ## 2 1110007 111 sch_friend11 629 ## 3 1110013 111 sch_friend11 232 ## 4 1110014 111 sch_friend11 582 ## 5 1110015 111 sch_friend11 26 ## 6 1110020 111 sch_friend11 528 ## 7 1110025 111 sch_friend11 135 ## 8 1110027 111 sch_friend11 346 ## 9 1110029 111 sch_friend11 369 ## 10 1110030 111 sch_friend11 462 ## # … with 39,551 more rows And finally, we create three new variables from this dataset: friendid, year, and nom_num (nomination number). All this using regular expressions: dat %&gt;% select(id, school, starts_with(&quot;sch_friend&quot;)) %&gt;% gather(key = &quot;varname&quot;, value = &quot;content&quot;, -id, -school) %&gt;% filter(!is.na(content)) %&gt;% mutate( friendid = school*10000 + content, year = as.integer(str_extract(varname, &quot;(?&lt;=[a-z])[0-9]&quot;)), nnom = as.integer(str_extract(varname, &quot;(?&lt;=[a-z][0-9])[0-9]+&quot;)) ) ## # A tibble: 39,561 x 7 ## id school varname content friendid year nnom ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 1110002 111 sch_friend11 424 1110424 1 1 ## 2 1110007 111 sch_friend11 629 1110629 1 1 ## 3 1110013 111 sch_friend11 232 1110232 1 1 ## 4 1110014 111 sch_friend11 582 1110582 1 1 ## 5 1110015 111 sch_friend11 26 1110026 1 1 ## 6 1110020 111 sch_friend11 528 1110528 1 1 ## 7 1110025 111 sch_friend11 135 1110135 1 1 ## 8 1110027 111 sch_friend11 346 1110346 1 1 ## 9 1110029 111 sch_friend11 369 1110369 1 1 ## 10 1110030 111 sch_friend11 462 1110462 1 1 ## # … with 39,551 more rows The regular expression (?&lt;=[a-z]) matches a string that is preceeded by any letter from a to z, whereas the expression [0-9] matches a single number. Hence, from the string \"sch_friend12\", the regular expression will only match the 1, as it is the only number followed by a letter. On the other hand, the expression (?&lt;=[a-z][0-9]) matches a string that is preceeded by a letter from a to z and a number from 0 to 9; and the expression [0-9]+ matches a string of numbers–so it could be more than one. Hence, from the string \"sch_friend12\", we will get 2. We can actually se this str_extract(&quot;sch_friend12&quot;, &quot;(?&lt;=[a-z])[0-9]&quot;) ## [1] &quot;1&quot; str_extract(&quot;sch_friend12&quot;, &quot;(?&lt;=[a-z][0-9])[0-9]+&quot;) ## [1] &quot;2&quot; And finally, the as.integer function coerces the returning value from the str_extract function from character to integer. Now that we have this edgelist, we can create an igraph object 4.2.2 igraph network For coercing the edgelist into an igraph object, we will be using the graph_from_data_frame function in igraph (Csardi and Nepusz 2006). This function receives a data frame where the two first columns are sorce(ego) and target(alter), whether is it directed or not, and an optional data frame with vertices, in which’s first column should contain the vertex ids. Using the optional vertices argument is a good practice since by doing so you are telling the function what is the set of vertex ids that you are expecting to find. Using the original dataset, we will create a data frame name vertices: vertex_attrs &lt;- dat %&gt;% select(id, school, hispanic, female1, starts_with(&quot;eversmk&quot;)) Now, let’s now use the function graph_from_data_frame to create an igraph object: library(igraph) ig_year1 &lt;- net %&gt;% filter(year == &quot;1&quot;) %&gt;% select(id, friendid, nnom) %&gt;% graph_from_data_frame( vertices = vertex_attrs ) ## Error in graph_from_data_frame(., vertices = vertex_attrs): Some vertex names in edge list are not listed in vertex data frame Ups! It seems that individuals are making nominations to other students that were not included on the survery. How to solve that? Well, it all depends on what you need to do! In this case, we will go for the quietly-remove-em’-and-don’t-tell strategy: ig_year1 &lt;- net %&gt;% filter(year == &quot;1&quot;) %&gt;% # Extra line, all nominations must be in ego too. filter(friendid %in% id) %&gt;% select(id, friendid, nnom) %&gt;% graph_from_data_frame( vertices = vertex_attrs ) ig_year1 ## IGRAPH d5062c8 DN-- 2164 9514 -- ## + attr: name (v/c), school (v/n), hispanic (v/n), female1 (v/n), ## | eversmk1 (v/n), eversmk2 (v/n), eversmk3 (v/n), eversmk4 (v/n), ## | nnom (e/n) ## + edges from d5062c8 (vertex names): ## [1] 1110007-&gt;1110629 1110013-&gt;1110232 1110014-&gt;1110582 1110015-&gt;1110026 ## [5] 1110025-&gt;1110135 1110027-&gt;1110346 1110029-&gt;1110369 1110035-&gt;1110034 ## [9] 1110040-&gt;1110390 1110041-&gt;1110557 1110044-&gt;1110027 1110046-&gt;1110030 ## [13] 1110050-&gt;1110086 1110057-&gt;1110263 1110069-&gt;1110544 1110071-&gt;1110167 ## [17] 1110072-&gt;1110289 1110073-&gt;1110014 1110075-&gt;1110352 1110084-&gt;1110305 ## [21] 1110086-&gt;1110206 1110093-&gt;1110040 1110094-&gt;1110483 1110095-&gt;1110043 ## + ... omitted several edges So there we have, our network with 2164 nodes and 9514 edges. The next steps: get some descriptive stats and visualize our network. References "],["network-descriptive-stats.html", "4.3 Network descriptive stats", " 4.3 Network descriptive stats While we could do all networks at once, in this part we will focus on computing some network statistics for one of the schools only. We start by school 111. The first question that you should be asking your self now is, “how can I get that information from the igraph object?.” Well, vertex attributes and edges attributes can be accessed via the V and E functions respectively; moreover, we can list what vertex/edge attributes are available: list.vertex.attributes(ig_year1) ## [1] &quot;name&quot; &quot;school&quot; &quot;hispanic&quot; &quot;female1&quot; &quot;eversmk1&quot; &quot;eversmk2&quot; &quot;eversmk3&quot; ## [8] &quot;eversmk4&quot; list.edge.attributes(ig_year1) ## [1] &quot;nnom&quot; Just like we would do with data frames, accessing vertex attributes is done via the dollar sign operator $ together with the V function, for example, accessing the first 10 elements of the variable hispanic can be done as follows: V(ig_year1)$hispanic[1:10] ## [1] 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 Now that you know how to access vertex attributes, we can get the network corresponding to school 111 by identifying which vertices are part of it and pass that information to the induced_subgraph function: # Which ids are from school 111? school111ids &lt;- which(V(ig_year1)$school == 111) # Creating a subgraph ig_year1_111 &lt;- induced_subgraph( graph = ig_year1, vids = school111ids ) The which function in R returns a vector of indices indicating which elements are true. In our case it will return a vector of indices of the vertices which have the attribute school equal to 111. Now that we have our subgraph, we can compute different centrality measures4 for each vertex and store them in the igraph object itself: # Computing centrality measures for each vertex V(ig_year1_111)$indegree &lt;- degree(ig_year1_111, mode = &quot;in&quot;) V(ig_year1_111)$outdegree &lt;- degree(ig_year1_111, mode = &quot;out&quot;) V(ig_year1_111)$closeness &lt;- closeness(ig_year1_111, mode = &quot;total&quot;) ## Warning in closeness(ig_year1_111, mode = &quot;total&quot;): At centrality.c: ## 2784 :closeness centrality is not well-defined for disconnected graphs V(ig_year1_111)$betweeness &lt;- betweenness(ig_year1_111, normalized = TRUE) From here, we can go back to our old habits and get the set of vertex attributes as a data frame so we can compute some summary statistics on the centrality measurements that we just got # Extracting each vectex features as a data.frame stats &lt;- as_data_frame(ig_year1_111, what = &quot;vertices&quot;) # Computing quantiles for each variable stats_degree &lt;- with(stats, { cbind( indegree = quantile(indegree, c(.025, .5, .975)), outdegree = quantile(outdegree, c(.025, .5, .975)), closeness = quantile(closeness, c(.025, .5, .975)), betweeness = quantile(betweeness, c(.025, .5, .975)) ) }) stats_degree ## indegree outdegree closeness betweeness ## 2.5% 0 0 3.526640e-06 0.000000000 ## 50% 4 4 1.595431e-05 0.001879006 ## 97.5% 16 16 1.601822e-05 0.016591048 The with function is somewhat similar to what dplyr allows us to do when we want to work with the dataset but without mentioning its name everytime that we ask for a variable. Without using the with function, the previous could have been done as follows: stats_degree &lt;- cbind( indegree = quantile(stats$indegree, c(.025, .5, .975)), outdegree = quantile(stats$outdegree, c(.025, .5, .975)), closeness = quantile(stats$closeness, c(.025, .5, .975)), betweeness = quantile(stats$betweeness, c(.025, .5, .975)) ) Now we will compute some statistics at the graph level: cbind( size = vcount(ig_year1_111), nedges = ecount(ig_year1_111), density = edge_density(ig_year1_111), recip = reciprocity(ig_year1_111), centr = centr_betw(ig_year1_111)$centralization, pathLen = mean_distance(ig_year1_111) ) ## size nedges density recip centr pathLen ## [1,] 533 2638 0.009303277 0.3731513 0.02179154 4.23678 Triadic census triadic &lt;- triad_census(ig_year1_111) triadic ## [1] 24059676 724389 290849 3619 3383 4401 3219 2997 ## [9] 407 33 836 235 163 137 277 85 To get a nicer view of this, we can use a table that I retrieved from ?triad_census.

So either approach is correct.↩︎ "],["plotting-the-network-in-igraph.html", "4.4 Plotting the network in igraph", " 4.4 Plotting the network in igraph 4.4.1 Single plot Let’s take a look at how does our network looks like when we use the default parameters in the plot method of the igraph object: plot(ig_year1) Figure 4.1: A not very nice network plot. This is what we get with the default parameters in igraph. Not very nice, right? A couple of things with this plot: We are looking at all schools simultaneously, which does not make sense. So, instead of plotting ig_year1, we will focus on ig_year1_111. All the vertices have the same size, and more over, are overalaping. So, instead of using the default size, we will size the vertices by indegree using the degree function, and passing the vector of degrees to vertex.size.6 Given the number of vertices in these networks, the labels are not useful here. So we will remove them by setting vertex.label = NA. Moreover, we will reduce the size of the arrows’ tip by setting edge.arrow.size = 0.25. And finally, we will set the color of each vertex to be a function of whether the individual is hispanic or not. For this last bit we need to go a bit more of programming: col_hispanic &lt;- V(ig_year1_111)$hispanic + 1 col_hispanic &lt;- coalesce(col_hispanic, 3) col_hispanic &lt;- c(&quot;steelblue&quot;, &quot;tomato&quot;, &quot;white&quot;)[col_hispanic] Line by line, we did the following: The first line added one to all no NA values, so that the 0s (non-hispanic) turned to 1s and the 1s (hispanic) turned to 2s. The second line replaced all NAs with the number 3, so that our vector col_hispanic now ranges from 1 to 3 with no NAs in it. In the last line we created a vector of colors. Essentially, what we are doing here is telling R to create a vector of length length(col_hispanic) by selecting elements by index from the vector c(\"steelblue\", \"tomato\", \"white\"). This way, if, for example, the first element of the vector col_hispanic was a 3, our new vector of colors would have a \"white\" in it. To make sure we know we are right, let’s print the first 10 elements of our new vector of colors together with the original hispanic column: cbind( original = V(ig_year1_111)$hispanic[1:10], colors = col_hispanic[1:10] ) ## original colors ## [1,] &quot;1&quot; &quot;tomato&quot; ## [2,] &quot;1&quot; &quot;tomato&quot; ## [3,] &quot;0&quot; &quot;steelblue&quot; ## [4,] &quot;1&quot; &quot;tomato&quot; ## [5,] &quot;1&quot; &quot;tomato&quot; ## [6,] &quot;1&quot; &quot;tomato&quot; ## [7,] &quot;1&quot; &quot;tomato&quot; ## [8,] &quot;1&quot; &quot;tomato&quot; ## [9,] &quot;0&quot; &quot;steelblue&quot; ## [10,] &quot;1&quot; &quot;tomato&quot; With our nice vector of colors, now we can pass it to plot.igraph (which we call implicitly by just calling plot), via the vertex.color argument: # Fancy graph set.seed(1) plot( ig_year1_111, vertex.size = degree(ig_year1_111)/10 +1, vertex.label = NA, edge.arrow.size = .25, vertex.color = col_hispanic ) Figure 4.2: Friends network in time 1 for school 111. Nice! So it does look better. The only problem is that we have a lot of isolates. Let’s try again by drawing the same plot without isolates. To do so we need to filter the graph, for which we will use the function induced_subgraph # Which vertices are not isolates? which_ids &lt;- which(degree(ig_year1_111, mode = &quot;total&quot;) &gt; 0) # Getting the subgraph ig_year1_111_sub &lt;- induced_subgraph(ig_year1_111, which_ids) # We need to get the same subset in col_hispanic col_hispanic &lt;- col_hispanic[which_ids] # Fancy graph set.seed(1) plot( ig_year1_111_sub, vertex.size = degree(ig_year1_111_sub)/5 +1, vertex.label = NA, edge.arrow.size = .25, vertex.color = col_hispanic ) Figure 4.3: Friends network in time 1 for school 111. The graph excludes isolates. Now that’s better! An interesting pattern that shows up is that individuals seem to cluster by whether they are hispanic or not. We can actually write this as a function so that, instead of us copying and pasting the code \\(n\\) times (supposing that we want to crate a plot similar to this \\(n\\) times). The next subsection does that. 4.4.2 Multiple plots When you are repeating yourself over and over again, it is a good idea to write down a sequence of commands as a function. In this case, since we will be running the same type of plot for all schools/waves, we write a function in which the only things that changes are: (a) the school id, and (b) the color of the nodes. myplot &lt;- function( net, schoolid, mindgr = 1, vcol = &quot;tomato&quot;, ...) { # Creating a subgraph subnet &lt;- induced_subgraph( net, which(degree(net, mode = &quot;all&quot;) &gt;= mindgr &amp; V(net)$school == schoolid) ) # Fancy graph set.seed(1) plot( subnet, vertex.size = degree(subnet)/5, vertex.label = NA, edge.arrow.size = .25, vertex.color = vcol, ... ) } The function definition: The myplot &lt;- function([arguments]) {[body of the function]} tells R that we are going to create a function called myplot. In the arguments part, we are declaring 4 specific arguments: net, schoolid, mindgr, and vcol. These are an igraph object, the school id, the minimum degree that a vertex must have to be included in the plot, and the color of the vertices. Notice that, as a difference from other programming languages, in R we don’t need to declare the types that these objects are. The elipsis object, ..., is a special object in R that allows us passing other arguments without us specifying which. In our case, if you take a look at the plot bit of the body of the function, you will see that we also added ...; this means that whatever other arguments (different from the ones that we explicitly defined) are passed to the function, these will be passed to the function plot, moreover, to the plot.gexf function (since the subnet object is actually an igraph object). In practice, this implies that we can, for example, set the argument edge.arrow.size when calling myplot, even though we did not included it in the function definition! (See ?dotsMethods in R for more details). In the following lines of code, using our new function, we will plot each schools’ network in the same plotting device (window) with the help of the par function, and add legend with the legend: # Plotting all together oldpar &lt;- par(no.readonly = TRUE) par(mfrow = c(2, 3), mai = rep(0, 4), oma= c(1, 0, 0, 0)) myplot(ig_year1, 111, vcol = &quot;tomato&quot;) myplot(ig_year1, 112, vcol = &quot;steelblue&quot;) myplot(ig_year1, 113, vcol = &quot;black&quot;) myplot(ig_year1, 114, vcol = &quot;gold&quot;) myplot(ig_year1, 115, vcol = &quot;white&quot;) par(oldpar) # A fancy legend legend( &quot;bottomright&quot;, legend = c(111, 112, 113, 114, 115), pt.bg = c(&quot;tomato&quot;, &quot;steelblue&quot;, &quot;black&quot;, &quot;gold&quot;, &quot;white&quot;), pch = 21, cex = 1, bty = &quot;n&quot;, title = &quot;School&quot; ) Figure 4.4: All 5 schools in time 1. Again, the graphs exclude isolates. So what happend here? oldpar &lt;- par(no.readonly = TRUE) This line stores the current parameters for plotting. Since we are going to be changing them, we better make sure we are able to go back!. par(mfrow = c(2, 3), mai = rep(0, 4), oma=rep(0, 4)) Here we are setting various things at the same time. mfrow specifies how many figures will be drawn and in what order, in particular, we are asking the plotting device to allow for 2*3 = 6 plots organized in 2 rows and 3 columns, and these will be drawn by row. mai specifies the size of the margins in inches. Setting all margins equal to zero (which is what we are doing now) gives more space to the network itself. The same is true for oma. See ?par for more info. myplot(ig_year1, ...) This is simply calling our plotting function. The neat part of this is that, since we set mfrow = c(2, 3), R takes care of distributing the plots in the device. par(oldpar) This line allows us to restore the plotting parameters. Figuring out what is the optimal vertex size is a bit tricky. Without getting too technical, there’s no other way of getting nice vertex size other than just playing with different values of it. A nice solution to this is using netdiffuseR::igraph_vertex_rescale which rescales the vertices so that these keep their aspect ratio to a predefined proportion of the screen.↩︎ "],["statistical-tests.html", "4.5 Statistical tests", " 4.5 Statistical tests 4.5.1 Is nomination number correlated with indegree?

To this end, a network dataset, like those depicted in Figure 1, may be considered as the response in a regression model, where the predictors are things like “propensity for individuals of the same sex to form partnerships” or “propensity for individuals to form triangles of partnerships.” In Figure 1(b), for example, it is evident that the individual nodes appear to cluster in groups of the same numerical labels (which turn out to be students’ grades, 7 through 12); thus, an ERGM can help us quantify the strength of this intra-group effect. — (David R. Hunter et al. 2008) Source: Hunter et al. (2008) In a nutshell, we use ERGMs as a parametric interpretation of the distribution of \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\), which takes the canonical form: \\[ \\mbox{Pr}\\left(\\mathbf{Y}=\\mathbf{y}|\\theta, \\mathcal{Y}\\right) = \\frac{\\mbox{exp}\\left\\{\\theta^{\\mbox{T}}\\mathbf{g}(\\mathbf{y})\\right\\}}{\\kappa\\left(\\theta, \\mathcal{Y}\\right)},\\quad\\mathbf{y}\\in\\mathcal{Y} \\tag{5.1} \\] Where \\(\\theta\\in\\Omega\\subset\\mathbb{R}^q\\) is the vector of model coefficients and \\(\\mathbf{g}(\\mathbf{y})\\) is a q-vector of statistics based on the adjacency matrix \\(\\mathbf{y}\\). Model (5.1) may be expanded by replacing \\(\\mathbf{g}(\\mathbf{y})\\) with \\(\\mathbf{g}(\\mathbf{y}, \\mathbf{X})\\) to allow for additional covariate information \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) about the network. The denominator, \\[ \\kappa\\left(\\theta,\\mathcal{Y}\\right) = \\sum_{\\mathbf{y}\\in\\mathcal{Y}}\\mbox{exp}\\left\\{\\theta^{\\mbox{T}}\\mathbf{g}(\\mathbf{y})\\right\\} \\] ,is the normalizing factor that ensures that equation (5.1) is a legitimate probability distribution. Even after fixing \\(\\mathcal{Y}\\) to be all the networks that have size \\(n\\), the size of \\(\\mathcal{Y}\\) makes this type of statistical model hard to estimate as there are \\(N = 2^{n(n-1)}\\) possible networks! (David R. Hunter et al. 2008) Recent developments include new forms of dependency structures to take into account more general neighborhood effects. These models relax the one-step Markovian dependence assumptions, allowing investigation of longer-range configurations, such as longer paths in the network or larger cycles (Pattison and Robins 2002). Models for bipartite (Faust and Skvoretz 1999) and tripartite (Mische and Robins 2000) network structures have been developed. (David R.

In a standard setting, we would be able to use Maximum-Likelihood-Estimation (MLE), which consists of finding the model parameters \\(\\theta\\) that, given the observed data, maximize the likelihood of the model. For the latter, we generally use Newton’s method. Newton’s method requires been able to compute the log-likelihood of the model, which in ERGMs can be challenging. For ERGMs, since part of the likelihood involves a normalizing constant that is a function of all possible networks, this is not as straightforward as in the regular setting. Because of it, most estimation methods rely on simulations. In statnet, the default estimation method is based on a method proposed by (Geyer and Thompson 1992), Markov-Chain MLE, which uses Markov-Chain Monte Carlo for simulating networks and a modified version of the Newton-Raphson algorithm to estimate the parameters. The idea of MC-MLE for this family of statistical models is that we can approximate the expectation of normalizing constant ratios using the law of large numbers. In particular, the following: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\frac{\\kappa\\left(\\theta,\\mathcal{Y}\\right)}{\\kappa\\left(\\theta_0,\\mathcal{Y}\\right)} &amp; = % \\frac{% \\sum_{\\mathbf{y}\\in\\mathcal{Y}}\\mbox{exp}\\left\\{\\theta^{\\mbox{T}}\\mathbf{g}(\\mathbf{y})\\right\\}}{ % \\sum_{\\mathbf{y}\\in\\mathcal{Y}}\\mbox{exp}\\left\\{\\theta_0^{\\mbox{T}}\\mathbf{g}(\\mathbf{y})\\right\\} } \\\\ &amp; = \\sum_{\\mathbf{y}\\in\\mathcal{Y}}\\left( % \\frac{1}{% \\sum_{\\mathbf{y}\\in\\mathcal{Y}\\mbox{exp}\\left\\{\\theta_0^{\\mbox{T}}\\mathbf{g}(\\mathbf{y})\\right\\}}% } \\times % \\mbox{exp}\\left\\{\\theta^{\\mbox{T}}\\mathbf{g}(\\mathbf{y})\\right\\} % \\right) \\\\ &amp; = \\sum_{\\mathbf{y}\\in\\mathcal{Y}}\\left( % \\frac{\\mbox{exp}\\left\\{\\theta_0^{\\mbox{T}}\\mathbf{g}(\\mathbf{y})\\right\\}}{% \\sum_{\\mathbf{y}\\in\\mathcal{Y}\\mbox{exp}\\left\\{\\theta_0^{\\mbox{T}}\\mathbf{g}(\\mathbf{y})\\right\\}}% } \\times % \\mbox{exp}\\left\\{(\\theta - \\theta_0)^{\\mbox{T}}\\mathbf{g}(\\mathbf{y})\\right\\} % \\right) \\\\ &amp; = \\sum_{\\mathbf{y}\\in\\mathcal{Y}}\\left( % \\mbox{Pr}\\left(Y = y|\\mathcal{Y}, \\theta_0\\right) \\times % \\mbox{exp}\\left\\{(\\theta - \\theta_0)^{\\mbox{T}}\\mathbf{g}(\\mathbf{y})\\right\\} % \\right) \\\\ &amp; = \\mbox{E}_{\\theta_0}\\left(\\mbox{exp}\\left\\{(\\theta - \\theta_0)^{\\mbox{T}}\\mathbf{g}(\\mathbf{y})\\right\\} \\right) \\end{aligned} \\] In particular, the MC-MLE algorithm uses this fact to maximize the ratio of log-likelihoods. The objective function itself can be approximated by simulating \\(m\\) networks from the distribution with parameter \\(\\theta_0\\): \\[ l(\\theta) - l(\\theta_0) \\approx (\\theta - \\theta_0)^{\\mbox{T}}\\mathbf{g}(\\mathbf{y}_{obs}) - \\mbox{log}{\\left[\\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{i = 1}^m\\mbox{exp}\\left\\{(\\theta-\\theta_0)^{\\mbox{T}}\\right\\}\\mathbf{g}(\\mathbf{Y}_i)\\right]} \\] For more details, see (David R. Hunter et al. 2008). A sketch of the algorithm follows: Initialize the algorithm with an initial guess of \\(\\theta\\), call it \\(\\theta^{(t)}\\) (must be a rather OK guess) While (no convergence) do: Using \\(\\theta^{(t)}\\), simulate \\(M\\) networks by means of small changes in the \\(\\mathbf{Y}_{obs}\\) (the observed network). This part is done by using an importance-sampling method which weights each proposed network by it’s likelihood conditional on \\(\\theta^{(t)}\\) With the networks simulated, we can do the Newton step to update the parameter \\(\\theta^{(t)}\\) (this is the iteration part in the ergm package): \\(\\theta^{(t)}\\to\\theta^{(t+1)}\\). If convergence has been reached (which usually means that \\(\\theta^{(t)}\\) and \\(\\theta^{(t + 1)}\\) are not very different), then stop; otherwise, go to step a. For more details see (Lusher, Koskinen, and Robins 2012; Admiraal and Handcock 2006; T. A. Snijders 2002; Wang et al. 2009) provides details on the algorithm used by PNet (which is the same as the one used in RSiena). (Lusher, Koskinen, and Robins 2012) provides a short discussion on differences between ergm and PNet.

The latter provides functions to go back and forth between igraph and network objects from the igraph and network packages respectively8 library(ergm) library(intergraph) As a rather important side note, the order in which R packages are loaded matters. Why is this important to mention now? Well, it turns out that at least a couple of functions in the network package have the same name of some functions in the igraph package. When the ergm package is loaded, since it depends on network, it will load the network package first, which will mask some functions in igraph. This becomes evident once you load ergm after loading igraph: The following objects are masked from ‘package:igraph’: add.edges, add.vertices, %c%, delete.edges, delete.vertices, get.edge.attribute, get.edges, get.vertex.attribute, is.bipartite, is.directed, list.edge.attributes, list.vertex.attributes, %s%, set.edge.attribute, set.vertex.attribute What are the implications of this? If you call the function list.edge.attributes for an object of class igraph R will return an error as the first function that matches that name comes from the network package! To avoid this you can use the double colon notation: igraph::list.edge.attributes(my_igraph_object) network::list.edge.attributes(my_network_object) Anyway… Using the asNetwork function, we can coerce the igraph object into a network object so we can use it with the ergm function: # Creating the new network network_111 &lt;- intergraph::asNetwork(ig_year1_111) # Running a simple ergm (only fitting edge count) ergm(network_111 ~ edges) ## [1] &quot;Warning: This network contains loops&quot; ## [1] &quot;Warning: This network contains loops&quot; ## Starting maximum pseudolikelihood estimation (MPLE): ## Evaluating the predictor and response matrix. ## Maximizing the pseudolikelihood. ## Finished MPLE. ## Stopping at the initial estimate. ## Evaluating log-likelihood at the estimate. ## ## MLE Coefficients: ## edges ## -4.734 So what happened here!

Here is an example of a couple of models that we could compare9 ans0 &lt;- ergm( network_111 ~ edges + nodematch(&quot;hispanic&quot;) + nodematch(&quot;female1&quot;) + nodematch(&quot;eversmk1&quot;) + mutual , constraints = ~bd(maxout = 19), control = control.ergm( seed = 1, MCMLE.maxit = 10, parallel = 4, CD.maxit = 10 ) ) ## Warning in nobs.ergm(object, ...): The number of observed dyads in this ## network is ill-defined due to complex constraints on the sample space. ## Disable this warning with &#39;options(ergm.loglik.warn_dyads=FALSE)&#39;. ## Warning in nobs.ergm(object, ...): The number of observed dyads in this ## network is ill-defined due to complex constraints on the sample space. ## Disable this warning with &#39;options(ergm.loglik.warn_dyads=FALSE)&#39;. So what are we doing here: The model is controlling for: edges Number of edges in the network (as opposed to its density) nodematch(\"some-variable-name-here\") Includes a term that controls for homophily/heterophily mutual Number of mutual connections between \\((i, j), (j, i)\\). This can be related to, for example, triadic closure. For more on control parameters, see (Morris, Handcock, and Hunter 2008). ans1 &lt;- ergm( network_111 ~ edges + nodematch(&quot;hispanic&quot;) + nodematch(&quot;female1&quot;) + nodematch(&quot;eversmk1&quot;) , constraints = ~bd(maxout = 19), control = control.ergm( seed = 1, MCMLE.maxit = 10, parallel = 4, CD.maxit = 10 ) ) ## Warning in nobs.ergm(object, ...): The number of observed dyads in this ## network is ill-defined due to complex constraints on the sample space. ## Disable this warning with &#39;options(ergm.loglik.warn_dyads=FALSE)&#39;. ## Warning in nobs.ergm(object, ...): The number of observed dyads in this ## network is ill-defined due to complex constraints on the sample space. ## Disable this warning with &#39;options(ergm.loglik.warn_dyads=FALSE)&#39;.

This implies that, since we are running the model with more than 1 chain, we can use all the samples (chains) as a single dataset. Recent changes in the ergm estimation algorithm mean that these plots can no longer be used to ensure that the mean statistics from the model match the observed network statistics. For that functionality, please use the GOF command: gof(object, GOF=~model). —?ergm::mcmc.diagnostics Since ans0 is the one model which did best, let’s take a look at it’s GOF statistics. First, lets see how the MCMC did. For this we can use the mcmc.diagnostics function including in the package. This function is actually a wrapper of a couple of functions from the coda package (Plummer et al. 2006) which is called upon the $sample object which holds the centered statistics from the sampled networks. This last point is important to consider since at first look it can be confusing to look at the $sample object since it neither matches the observed statistics, nor the coefficients. When calling the function mcmc.diagnostics(ans0, centered = FALSE), you will see a lot of output including a couple of plots showing the trace and posterior distribution of the uncentered statistics (centered = FALSE). In the next code chunks we will reproduce the output from the mcmc.diagnostics function step by step using the coda package. First we need to uncenter the sample object: # Getting the centered sample sample_centered &lt;- ans0$sample # Getting the observed statistics and turning it into a matrix so we can add it # to the samples observed &lt;- summary(ans0$formula) observed &lt;- matrix( observed, nrow = nrow(sample_centered[[1]]), ncol = length(observed), byrow = TRUE ) # Now we uncenter the sample sample_uncentered &lt;- lapply(sample_centered, function(x) { x + observed }) # We have to make it an mcmc.list object sample_uncentered &lt;- coda::mcmc.list(sample_uncentered) Under the hood: Empirical means and sd, and quantiles: summary(sample_uncentered) ## ## Iterations = 16384:1063936 ## Thinning interval = 1024 ## Number of chains = 4 ## Sample size per chain = 1024 ## ## 1.

Convergence is diagnosed when the chains have ‘forgotten’ their initial values, and the output from all chains is indistinguishable. The gelman.diag diagnostic is applied to a single variable from the chain. It is based a comparison of within-chain and between-chain variances, and is similar to a classical analysis of variance. —?coda::gelman.diag As a difference from the previous diagnostic statistic, this uses all chains simulatenously: coda::gelman.diag(sample_uncentered) ## Potential scale reduction factors: ## ## Point est.

One nice feature of the mcmc.diagnostics function is the nice trace and posterior distribution plots that it generates. If you have the R package latticeExtra (Sarkar and Andrews 2016), the function will override the default plots used by coda::plot.mcmc and use lattice instead, creating a nicer looking plots. The next code chunk calls the mcmc.diagnostic function, but we suppress the rest of the output (see figure ??). mcmc.diagnostics(ans0, center = FALSE) # Suppressing all the output Figure 5.1: Trace and posterior distribution of sampled network statistics. Figure 5.2: Trace and posterior distribution of sampled network statistics (cont’d). If we called the function mcmc.diagnostics, this message appears at the end: MCMC diagnostics shown here are from the last round of simulation, prior to computation of final parameter estimates. Because the final estimates are refinements of those used for this simulation run, these diagnostics may understate model performance. To directly assess the performance of the final model on in-model statistics, please use the GOF command: gof(ergmFitObject, GOF=~model). —mcmc.diagnostics(ans0) Not that bad (although the mutual term could do better)!10 First, observe that in the figure we see four different lines; why is that? Since we were running in parallel using four cores, the algorithm ran four chains of the MCMC algorithm. An eyeball test is to see if all the chains moved at about the same place; in such a case, we can start thinking about model convergence from the MCMC perspective. Once we are sure to have reach convergence on the MCMC algorithm, we can start thinking about how well does our model predicts the observed network’s proterties.

References "],["mathematical-interpretation.html", "5.7 Mathematical Interpretation", " 5.7 Mathematical Interpretation One of the most critical parts of statistical modeling is interpreting the results, if not the most important. In the case of ERGMs, a key aspect is based on change statistics. Suppose that we would like to know how likely the tie \\(y_{ij}\\) is to happen, given the rest of the network. We can compute such probabilities using what literature sometimes describes as the Gibbs-sampler. In particular, the log-odds of the \\(ij\\) tie ocurring conditional on the rest of the network can be written as: \\[\\begin{equation} \\mbox{logit}\\left({\\mathbb{P}\\left(y_{ij} = 1|y_{-ij}\\right) }\\right) = {\\theta}^\\mathbf{t}\\Delta\\delta\\left(y_{ij}:0\\to 1\\right), \\end{equation}\\] with \\(\\delta\\left(y_{ij}:0\\to 1\\right)\\equiv s\\left(\\mathbf{y}\\right)_{\\mbox{ij}}^+ - s\\left(\\mathbf{y}\\right)_{\\mbox{ij}}^-\\) as the vector of change statistics, in other words, the difference between the sufficient statistics when \\(y_{ij}=1\\) and its value when \\(y_{ij} = 0\\). To show this, we write the following: \\[\\begin{align*} {\\mathbb{P}\\left(y_{ij} = 1|y_{-ij}\\right) } &amp; = % \\frac{{\\mathbb{P}\\left(y_{ij} = 1, x_{-ij}\\right) }}{% {\\mathbb{P}\\left(y_{ij} = 1, y_{-ij}\\right) } + {\\mathbb{P}\\left(y_{ij} = 0, y_{-ij}\\right) }} \\\\ &amp; = \\frac{\\mbox{exp}\\left\\{{\\theta}^\\mathbf{t}s\\left(\\mathbf{y}\\right)^+_{ij}\\right\\}}{% \\mbox{exp}\\left\\{{\\theta}^\\mathbf{t}s\\left(\\mathbf{y}\\right)^+_{ij}\\right\\} + \\mbox{exp}\\left\\{{\\theta}^\\mathbf{t}s\\left(\\mathbf{y}\\right)^-_{ij}\\right\\}} \\end{align*}\\] Applying the logit function to the previous equation, we obtain: \\[\\begin{align*} &amp; = \\mbox{log}\\left\\{\\frac{\\mbox{exp}\\left\\{{\\theta}^\\mathbf{t}s\\left(\\mathbf{y}\\right)^+_{ij}\\right\\}}{% \\mbox{exp}\\left\\{{\\theta}^\\mathbf{t}s\\left(\\mathbf{y}\\right)^+_{ij}\\right\\} + % \\mbox{exp}\\left\\{{\\theta}^\\mathbf{t}s\\left(\\mathbf{y}\\right)^-_{ij}\\right\\}}\\right\\} - % \\mbox{log}\\left\\{ % \\frac{\\mbox{exp}\\left\\{{\\theta}^\\mathbf{t}s\\left(\\mathbf{y}\\right)^-_{ij}\\right\\}}{% \\mbox{exp}\\left\\{{\\theta}^\\mathbf{t}s\\left(\\mathbf{y}\\right)^+_{ij}\\right\\} + \\mbox{exp}\\left\\{{\\theta}^\\mathbf{t}s\\left(\\mathbf{y}\\right)^-_{ij}\\right\\}}% \\right\\} \\\\ &amp; = \\mbox{log}\\left\\{\\mbox{exp}\\left\\{{\\theta}^\\mathbf{t}s\\left(\\mathbf{y}\\right)^+_{ij}\\right\\}\\right\\} - \\mbox{log}\\left\\{\\mbox{exp}\\left\\{{\\theta}^\\mathbf{t}s\\left(\\mathbf{y}\\right)^-_{ij}\\right\\}\\right\\} \\\\ &amp; = {\\theta}^\\mathbf{t}\\left(s\\left(\\mathbf{y}\\right)^+_{ij} - s\\left(\\mathbf{y}\\right)^-_{ij}\\right) \\\\ &amp; = {\\theta}^\\mathbf{t}\\Delta\\delta\\left(y_{ij}:0\\to 1\\right) \\end{align*}\\] Henceforth, the conditional probability of node \\(n\\) gaining function \\(k\\) can be written as: \\[\\begin{equation} {\\mathbb{P}\\left(y_{ij} = 1|y_{-ij}\\right) } = \\frac{1}{1 + \\mbox{exp}\\left\\{-{\\theta}^\\mathbf{t}\\Delta\\delta\\left(y_{ij}:0\\to 1\\right)\\right\\}} \\end{equation}\\] i.e., a logistic probability. "],["markov-independence.html", "5.8 Markov independence", " 5.8 Markov independence The challenge of analyzing networks is their interdependent nature. Nonetheless, in the absence of such interdependence, ERGMs are equivalent to logistic regression. Conceptually, if all the statistics included in the model do not involve two or more dyads, then the model is non-Markovian in the sense of Markov graphs. Mathematically, to see this, it suffices to show that the ERGM probability can be written as the product of each dyads’ probabilities. \\[\\begin{equation*} {\\mathbb{P}\\left(\\mathbf{y} | \\theta\\right) } = \\frac{\\mbox{exp}\\left\\{{\\theta}^\\mathbf{t}s\\left(\\mathbf{y}\\right)\\right\\}}{\\sum_{y}\\mbox{exp}\\left\\{{\\theta}^\\mathbf{t}s\\left(\\mathbf{y}\\right)\\right\\}} = \\frac{\\prod_{ij}\\mbox{exp}\\left\\{{\\theta}^\\mathbf{t}s\\left(\\mathbf{y}\\right)_{ij}\\right\\}}{\\sum_{y}\\mbox{exp}\\left\\{{\\theta}^\\mathbf{t}s\\left(\\mathbf{y}\\right)\\right\\}} \\end{equation*}\\] Where \\(s\\left(\\right)_{ij}\\) is a function such that \\(s\\left(\\mathbf{y}\\right) = \\sum_{ij}{s\\left(\\mathbf{y}\\right)_{ij}}\\).

Prevalence of a motif/pattern, e.g., check whether the observed number of transitive triads is different from that expected as of by chance. Multivariate using ERGMs, e.g., jointly test whether homophily and two stars are the motifs that drive network structure. The latter we already review in the ERGM chapter. In this part, we will look at types one and two; both using non-parametric methods. "],["comparing-networks.html", "8.1 Comparing networks", " 8.1 Comparing networks Imagine that we have two graphs, \\((G_1,G_2) \\in \\mathcal{G}\\), and we would like to assess whether a given statistic \\(s(\\cdot)\\), e.g., density, is equal in both of them. Formally, we would like to asses whether \\(H_0: s(G_1) - s(G_2) = k\\) vs \\(H_a: s(G_1) - s(G_2) \\neq k\\). As usual, the true distribution of \\(s(\\cdot)\\) is unknown, thus, one approach that we could use is a non-parametric bootstrap test. 8.1.1 Network bootstrap The non parametric bootstrap and jackknife methods for social networks were introduced by (T. A. B. Snijders and Borgatti 1999). The method itself is used to generate standard errors for network level statistics. Both methods are implemented in the R package netdiffuseR. 8.1.2 When the statistic is normal When the we deal with things that are normally distributed, e.g., sample means like density11, we can make use of the Student’s distribution for making inference. In particular, we can use Bootstrap/Jackknife to approximate the standard errors of the statistic for each network: Since \\(s(G_i)\\sim \\mbox{N}(\\mu_i,\\sigma_i^2/m_i)\\) for \\(i\\in\\{1,2\\}\\), in the case of the density, \\(m_i = n_i * (n_i - 1)\\). The statistic is then: \\[ s(G_1) - s(G_0)\\sim \\mbox{N}(\\mu_1-\\mu_0, \\sigma_1^2/m_1 + \\sigma_1^2/m_2) \\] Thus \\[ \\frac{s(G_1) - s(G_0) - \\mu_1 + \\mu_2}{\\sqrt{\\sigma_1^2/{m_1} + \\sigma_1^2/{m_2}}} \\sim t_{m_1 + m_2 - 2} \\] But, if we are testing \\(H_0: \\mu_1 - \\mu_2 = k\\), then, under the null \\[ \\frac{s(G_1) - s(G_0) - k}{\\sqrt{\\sigma_1^2/{m_1} + \\sigma_1^2/{m_2}}} \\sim t_{m_1 + m_2 - 2} \\] Where We now proceede to approximate the variances. Using the plugin principle (Efron and Tibshirani 1994), we can approximate the variances using Bootstrap/Jackknife, i.e., compute \\(\\hat\\sigma_1^2\\approx\\sigma_1^2/m_1\\) and \\(\\hat\\sigma_2^2\\approx\\sigma_2^2/m_2\\). Using netdiffuseR library(netdiffuseR) # Obtain a 100 replicates sg1 &lt;- bootnet(g1, function(i, ...) sum(i)/(nnodes(i) * (nnodes(i) - 1)), R = 100) sg2 &lt;- bootnet(g2, function(i, ...) sum(i)/(nnodes(i) * (nnodes(i) - 1)), R = 100) # Retrieving the variances hat_sigma1 &lt;- sg1$var_t hat_sigma2 &lt;- sg2$var_t # And the actual values sg1 &lt;- sg1$t0 sg2 &lt;- sg2$t0 With the approximates in hand, we can then use the the “t-test table” to retrieve the corresponding value, in R: # Building the statistic k &lt;- 0 # For equal variances tstat &lt;- (sg1 - sg2 - k)/(sqrt(hat_sigma1 + hat_sigma2)) # Computing the pvalue m1 &lt;- nnodes(g1)*(nnodes(g1) - 1) m2 &lt;- nnodes(g2)*(nnodes(g2) - 1) pt(tstat, df = m1 + m2 - 2) 8.1.3 When the statistic is NOT normal In the case that the statistic is not normally distributed, we cannot use the t-statistic any longer. Nevertheless, the Bootstrap can come to help. While in general it is better to use distributions of pivot statistics (see (Efron and Tibshirani 1994)), we can still leverage the power of this method to make inferences. For this example, \\(s(\\cdot)\\) will be the range of the threshold in a diffusion graph. As before, imagine that we are dealing with an statistic \\(s(\\cdot)\\) for two different networks, and we would like to asses whether we can reject \\(H_0\\) or fail to reject it. The procedure is very similar: One approach that we can test is whether \\(k \\in \\mbox{ConfInt}(s(G_1) - s(G_2))\\). Building confidence intervals with bootstrap could be more intuitive. Like before, we use bootstrap to generate a distribution of \\(s(G_1)\\) and \\(s(G_2)\\), in R: # Obtain a 1000 replicates sg1 &lt;- bootnet(g1, function(i, ...) range(threshold(i)), R = 1000) sg2 &lt;- bootnet(g2, function(i, ...) range(threshold(i)), R = 1000) # Retrieving the distributions sg1 &lt;- sg1$boot$t sg2 &lt;- sg2$boot$t # Define the statistic sdiff &lt;- sg1 - sg2 Once we have sdiff, we can proceed and compute the, for example, 95% confidence interval, and evaluate whether \\(k\\) falls within. In R: diff_ci &lt;- quantile(sdiff, probs = c(0.025, .975)) This corresponds to what Efron and Tibshirani call “percentile interval.” This is easy to compute, but a better approach is using the “BCa” method, “Bias Corrected and Accelerated.” (TBD) References "],["examples.html", "8.2 Examples", " 8.2 Examples 8.2.1 Average of node-level stats Supposed that we would like to compare something like average indegree. In particular, for both networks, \\(G_1\\) and \\(G_2\\), we compute the average indegree per node: \\[ s(G_1) = \\mbox{AvgIndeg}(G_1) = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i}\\sum_{j\\neq i}A^1_{ji} \\] where \\(A^1_{ji}\\) equals one if vertex \\(j\\) sends a tie to \\(i\\). In this case, since we are looking at an average, we have that \\(\\mbox{AvgIndeg}(G_1) \\sim N(\\mu_1, \\sigma^2_1/n)\\). Thus, taking advantage of the normality of the statistic, we can build a test statistic as follows: \\[ \\frac{s(G_1) - s(G_2) - k}{\\sqrt{\\hat\\sigma_{1}^2 + \\hat\\sigma_{2}^2}} \\sim t_{n_1 + n_2 - 2} \\] Where \\(\\hat\\sigma_i\\) is the bootstrap standard error, and \\(k = 0\\) when we are testing equality. This distributes \\(t\\) with \\(n_1+n_2-2\\) degrees of freedom. As a difference from the previous example using density, the degrees of freedom for this test are less as, instead of having an average across all entries of the adjacency matrix, we have an average across all vertices.

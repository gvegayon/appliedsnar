# SNS Exponential Random Graph Models

I strongly suggest reading the vignette included in the `ergm` R package

```r
vignette("ergm", package="ergm")
```

So what are ERGMs anyway...

> The purpose of ERGMs, in a nutshell, is to describe parsimoniously the local selection forces
that shape the global structure of a network. To this end, a network dataset, like those
depicted in Figure 1, may be considered like the response in a regression model, where the
predictors are things like “propensity for individuals of the same sex to form partnerships” or
“propensity for individuals to form triangles of partnerships”. In Figure 1(b), for example, it
is evident that the individual nodes appear to cluster in groups of the same numerical labels
(which turn out to be students’ grades, 7 through 12); thus, an ERGM can help us quantify
the strength of this intra-group effect.  --- [@Hunter2008]

The distribution of $\mathbf{Y}$ can be parameterized in the form

$$
\Pr{\mathbf{Y}=\mathbf{y}|\theta, \mathcal{Y}} = \frac{\exp{\theta^{\mbox{T}}\mathbf{g}(\mathbf{y})}}{\kappa\left(\theta, \mathcal{Y}\right)},\quad\mathbf{y}\in\mathcal{Y}
(\#eq:04-1)
$$

Where $\theta\in\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^q$ is the vector of model coefficients and $\mathbf{g}(\mathbf{y})$ is a *q*-vector of statistics based on the adjacency matrix $\mathbf{y}$.

Model \@ref(eq:04-1) may be expanded by replacing $\mathbf{g}(\mathbf{y})$ with $\mathbf{g}(\mathbf{y}, \mathbf{X})$ to allow for additional covariate information $\mathbf{X}$ about the network. The denominator,


$$
\kappa\left(\theta,\mathcal{Y}\right) = \sum_{\mathbf{z}\in\mathcal{Y}}\exp{\theta^{\mbox{T}}\mathbf{g}(\mathbf{z})}
$$

Is the normalizing factor that ensures that equation \@ref(eq:04-1) is a legitimate probability distribution. Even after fixing $\mathcal{Y}$ to be all the networks that have size $n$, the size of $\mathcal{Y}$ makes this type of models hard to estimate as there are $N = 2^{n(n-1)}$ possible networks!

## The `ergm` package

The `ergm` R package [@R-ergm]

From the previous section:^[You can download the 03.rda file from [this link](https://github.com/gvegayon/appliedsnar).]

```{r 04-setup, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(igraph)
library(magrittr)
library(dplyr)

load("03.rda")
```


In this section we will use the `ergm` package (from the `statnet`) suit, and the `intergraph` package. The latter provides functions to go back and forth between `igraph` and `network` objects from the `igraph` and `network` packages respectively^[Yes, the classes have the same name as the packages.]

```{r 03-ergms-setup, message=FALSE}
library(ergm)
library(intergraph)
```

Using the `asNetwork` function, we can coerce the igraph object into a network object so we can use it with the `ergm` function:

```{r 03-ergms-intergraph, cache=TRUE}
# Creating the new network
network_111 <- intergraph::asNetwork(ig_year1_111)

# Running a simple ergm (only fitting edge count)
ergm(network_111 ~ edges)
```

So what happened here! We got a warning. It turns out that our network has loops (didn't thought about it before!). Let's take a look on that with the `which_loop` function

```{r 03-ergms-which-loop}
E(ig_year1_111)[which_loop(ig_year1_111)]
```

We can get rid of these using the `igraph::-.igraph`. Moreover, just to illustrate how it can be done, let's get rid of the isolates using the same operator

```{r 03-ergms-intergraph2, cache=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
# Creating the new network
network_111 <- ig_year1_111

# Removing loops
network_111 <- network_111 - E(network_111)[which(which_loop(network_111))]

# Removing isolates
network_111 <- network_111 - which(degree(network_111, mode = "all") == 0)

# Converting the network
network_111 <- intergraph::asNetwork(network_111)
```

Proposed workflow:

1.  Estimate the simplest model, adding one variable at a time.

2.  After each estimation, run the `mcmc.diagnostics` function to see how good/bad behaved are the chains.

3.  Run the `gof` function to see how good is the model at matching the network's structural statistics.

What to use:

1.  `control.ergms`: Maximum number of iteration, seed for Pseudo-RNG, how many cores

2.  `ergm.constraints`: Where to sample the network from. Gives stability and (in some cases) faster convergence as by constraining the model you are reducing the sample size.

Here is an example of a couple of models that we could compare^[Notice that this document may not include the usual messages that the `ergm` command generates during the estimation procedure. This is just to make it more printable-friendly.]

```{r 04-ergms-model0, cache=TRUE, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
ans0 <- ergm(
  network_111 ~
    edges +
    nodematch("hispanic") +
    nodematch("female1") +
    nodematch("eversmk1") +
    mutual
    ,
  constraints = ~bd(maxout = 19),
  control = control.ergm(
    seed        = 1,
    MCMLE.maxit = 10,
    parallel    = 4,
    CD.maxit    = 10
    )
  )
```

So what are we doing here:
1.  The model is controling for: 
    a.  `edges` Number of edges in the network (as opposed to its density)
    b.  `nodematch("some-variable-name-here")` Includes a term that controls for homophily/heterophily
    c.  `mutual` Number of mutual connections between $i$ and $j$. This can be related to, for example, triadic closure.

```{r 04-ergms-model1, cache=TRUE, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
ans1 <- ergm(
  network_111 ~
    edges +
    nodematch("hispanic") +
    nodematch("female1") +
    nodematch("eversmk1")
    ,
  constraints = ~bd(maxout = 19, maxin = 22),
  control = control.ergm(
    seed        = 1,
    MCMLE.maxit = 10,
    parallel    = 4,
    CD.maxit    = 10
    )
  )
```

This example takes longer to compute

```{r 04-ergms-model2, cache=TRUE, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
ans2 <- ergm(
  network_111 ~
    edges +
    nodematch("hispanic") +
    nodematch("female1") +
    nodematch("eversmk1") + 
    mutual +
    balance
    ,
  constraints = ~bd(maxout = 19, maxin = 22),
  control = control.ergm(
    seed        = 1,
    MCMLE.maxit = 10,
    parallel    = 4,
    CD.maxit    = 10
    )
  )
```

Now, a nice trick to see all regressions in the same table, we can use the `texreg` package which supports `ergm` ouputs!

```{r 04-ergm-tabulation-screen}
library(texreg)
screenreg(list(ans0, ans1, ans2))
```

Or, if you are using rmarkdown, you can export the results using LaTeX or html, let's try the latter to see how it looks like here:

```{r 04-ergm-tabulation-html}
library(texreg)
htmlreg(list(ans0, ans1, ans2))
```

### Model Goodness-of-Fit

Since `ans0` is the one model which did best, let's take a look at it's GOF statistics. First, lets see how the MCMC did:

```{r checking-mcmc, cache = TRUE}
mcmc.diagnostics(ans0)
```

Not that bad! First, observe that in the plot we see 4 different lines, why is that? Well, since we were running in parallel using 4 cores the algorithm actually ran 4 different chains of the MCMC algorithm. An eyeball test is to see if all the chains moved at about the same place, if we have that we can start thinking about model convergence from the mcmc perspective.

What would be an indicator of no-convergence? Well, 

```{r checking-gof, cache = TRUE}
# Computing and printing GOF estatistics
ans_gof <- gof(ans0)
ans_gof

# Plotting GOF statistics
plot(ans_gof)
```

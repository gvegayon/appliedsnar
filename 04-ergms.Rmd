# SNS Exponential Random Graph Models

I strongly suggest reading the vignette included in the `ergm` R package

```r
vignette("ergm", package="ergm")
```

So what are ERGMs anyway...

> The purpose of ERGMs, in a nutshell, is to describe parsimoniously the local selection forces
that shape the global structure of a network. To this end, a network dataset, like those
depicted in Figure 1, may be considered like the response in a regression model, where the
predictors are things like “propensity for individuals of the same sex to form partnerships” or
“propensity for individuals to form triangles of partnerships”. In Figure 1(b), for example, it
is evident that the individual nodes appear to cluster in groups of the same numerical labels
(which turn out to be students’ grades, 7 through 12); thus, an ERGM can help us quantify
the strength of this intra-group effect.  --- [@Hunter2008]

The distribution of $\mathbf{Y}$ can be parameterized in the form

$$
\Prcond{\mathbf{Y}=\mathbf{y}}{\theta, \mathcal{Y}} = \frac{\exp{\theta^\mbox{T}\mathbf{g}(\mathbf{y})}}{\kappa\left(\theta, \mathcal{Y}\right)},\quad\mathbf{y}\in\mathcal{Y}
(\#eq:04-1)
$$

Where $\theta\in\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^q$ is the vector of model coefficients and $\mathbf{g}(\mathbf{y})$ is a *q*-vector of statistics based on the adjacency matrix $\mathbf{y}$.

Model \@ref(eq:04-1) may be expanded by replacing $\mathbf{g}(\mathbf{y})$ with $\mathbf{g}(\mathbf{y}, \mathbf{X})$ to allow for additional covariate information $\mathbf{X}$ about the network. The denominator,

$$
\kappa\left(\theta,\mathcal{Y}\right) = \sum_{\mathbf{z}\in\mathcal{Y}}\exp{\theta^\mbox{T}\mathbf{g}(\mathbf{z})}}
$$
Is the normalizing factor that ensures that equation \@ref(eq:04-1) is a legitimate probability distribution. Even after fixing $\mathcal{Y}$ to be all the networks that have size $n$, the size of $\mathcal{Y}$ makes this type of models hard to estimate as there are $N = 2^{n(n-1)}$ possible networks!

## The `ergm` package

From the previous section:^[You can download the 03.rda file from [this link](https://github.com/gvegayon/appliedsnar).]

```{r 04-setup}
library(igraph)
library(magrittr)
library(dplyr)

load("03.rda")
```


In this section we will use the `ergm` package (from the `statnet`) suit, and the `intergraph` package. The latter provides functions to go back and forth between `igraph` and `network` objects from the `igraph` and `network` packages respectively^[Yes, the classes have the same name as the packages.]

```{r 03-ergms-setup, message=FALSE}
library(ergm)
library(intergraph)
```

Using the `asNetwork` function, we can coerce the igraph object into a network object so we can use it with the `ergm` function:

```{r 03-ergms-intergraph, cache=TRUE}
# Creating the new network
network_111 <- intergraph::asNetwork(ig_year1_111)

# Running a simple ergm (only fitting edge count)
ergm(network_111 ~ edges)
```

So what happened here! We got a warning. It turns out that our network has loops (didn't thought about it before!). Let's take a look on that with the `which_loop` function

```{r 03-ergms-which-loop}
E(ig_year1_111)[which_loop(ig_year1_111)]
```

We can get rid of these using the `igraph::-.igraph`. Moreover, just to illustrate how it can be done, let's get rid of the isolates using the same operator

```{r 03-ergms-intergraph2, cache=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# Creating the new network
network_111 <- ig_year1_111

# Removing loops
network_111 <- network_111 - E(network_111)[which(which_loop(network_111))]

# Removing isolates
network_111 <- network_111 - which(degree(network_111, mode = "all") == 0)

# Converting the network
network_111 <- intergraph::asNetwork(network_111)
```

Let's rerun the model, now with a couple of extra terms

```{r 04-ergms-intergraph2, cache=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# Running a simple ergm (only fitting edge count)
ans0 <- ergm(
  network_111 ~
    edges +
    nodematch("hispanic") +
    gwesp(fixed=T),
  control = control.ergm(seed = 1)
  )

summary(ans0)
mcmc.diagnostics(ans0)
library(coda)
gof(ans0)

ans1 <- ergm(network_111 ~ edges + triangles, control = control.ergm(init = ans0$coef))

ans2 <- ergm(network_111 ~ edges + idegree1.5, control = control.ergm(init = ans1$coef, MCMLE.maxit=40))

ans3 <- ergm(
  network_111 ~ edges + idegree1.5,
  control = control.ergm(init = ans2$coef, MCMLE.maxit=40, parallel = 4L)
  )

summary(ans3)
```

Let's make it a bit more complex. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ans1 <- ergm(network_111 ~ edges + nodematch("hispanic") + nodematch("eversmk1"))
summary(ans1)
```

The terms specify network statistics that are sufficient to represent the probability distribution over the space of networks of that size. Many classes of statistics can be used.  In this article we describe the classes of statistics that are currently available in the ergm package. We also describe means for controlling the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that the package uses for estimation. These controls affect either the proposal distribution on the sample space used by the underlying Metropolis-Hastings algorithm or the constraints on the sample space itself. Finally, we describe various other arguments to core functions of the ergm package.},

 abstract = {Maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) in autologistic models and other exponential family models for dependent data can be calculated with Markov chain Monte Carlo methods (the Metropolis algorithm or the Gibbs sampler), which simulate ergodic Markov chains having equilibrium distributions in the model. From one realization of such a Markov chain, a Monte Carlo approximant to the whole likelihood function can be constructed. The parameter value (if any) maximizing this function approximates the MLE. When no parameter point in the model maximizes the likelihood, the MLE in the closure of the exponential family may exist and can be calculated by a two-phase algorithm, first finding the support of the MLE by linear programming and then finding the distribution within the family conditioned on the support by maximizing the likelihood for that family. These methods are illustrated by a constrained autologistic model for DNA fingerprint data. MLEs are compared with maximum pseudolikelihood estimates (MPLEs) and with maximum conditional likelihood estimates (MCLEs), neither of which produce acceptable estimates, the MPLE because it overestimates dependence, and the MCLE because conditioning removes the constraints.},

  abstract = {"Exponential random graph models (ERGMs) are a class of statistical models for social networks. They account for the presence (and absence) of network ties and so provide a model for network structure. An ERGM models a given network in terms of small local tie-based structures, such as reciprocated ties and triangles. A social network can be thought of as being built up of these local patterns of ties, called network configurations xe "network configurations" , which correspond to the parameters in the model. Moreover, these configurations can be considered to arise from local social processes, whereby actors in the network form connections in response to other ties in their social environment. ERGMs are a principled statistical approach to modeling social networks. They are theory-driven in that their use requires the researcher to consider the complex, intersecting and indeed potentially competing theoretical reasons why the social ties in the observed network have arisen. For instance, does a given network structure occur due to processes of homophily xe "actor-relation effects:homophily" , xe "homophily" {\textbackslash}t "see actor-relation effects" reciprocity xe "reciprocity" , transitivity xe "transitivity" , or indeed a combination of these? By including such parameters together in the one model a researcher can test these effects one against the other, and so infer the social processes that have built the network. Being a statistical model, an ERGM permits inferences about whether, in our network of interest, there are significantly more (or fewer) reciprocated ties, or triangles (for instance), than we would expect"--},

@article{Snijders2010,
abstract = {Stochastic actor-based models are models for network dynamics that can represent a wide variety of influences on network change, and allow to estimate parameters expressing such influences, and test corresponding hypotheses. The nodes in the network represent social actors, and the collection of ties represents a social relation. The assumptions posit that the network evolves as a stochastic process 'driven by the actors', i.e., the model lends itself especially for representing theories about how actors change their outgoing ties. The probabilities of tie changes are in part endogenously determined, i.e., as a function of the current network structure itself, and in part exogenously, as a function of characteristics of the nodes ('actor covariates') and of characteristics of pairs of nodes ('dyadic covariates'). In an extended form, stochastic actor-based models can be used to analyze longitudinal data on social networks jointly with changing attributes of the actors: dynamics of networks and behavior. This paper gives an introduction to stochastic actor-based models for dynamics of directed networks, using only a minimum of mathematics. The focus is on understanding the basic principles of the model, understanding the results, and on sensible rules for model selection. Crown Copyright {\textcopyright} 2009.},

One thousand four hundred and twenty-five racially and ethnically diverse youth from four high schools in Los Angeles were surveyed four times over the high school period from 2010 to 2013. Probit regression models and stochastic actor-based models for network dynamics tested for peer effects on smoking initiation. Friend smoking was found to predict adolescent smoking, and smoking initiation diffused through friendship networks in some but not all of the schools. School differences in smoking rates and the popularity of smokers may be linked to differences in the diffusion of smoking through peer networks. We conclude that there are differences in peer effects on smoking initiation across schools that will be important to account for in network-based smoking interventions.},

These models are along the lines of methodological individualism: actors use heuristics to try to achieve their individual goals, subject to constraints. The current net- work structure is among these constraints. The models are continuous time Markov chain models that can be implemented as simulation models. They incorporate random change in addition to the purposeful change that follows from the actors' pursuit of their goals, and include parameters that must be estimated from observed data. Statistical methods are proposed for estimat- ing and testing these models. These methods can also be used for parameter estimation for other simulation models. The statistical procedures are based on the method of moments, and use computer simulation to estimate the theoretical moments. The Robbins-Monro process is used to deal with the stochastic nature of the estimated theoretical moments. An example is given for Newcomb's fraternity data, using a model that expresses reciprocity and balance.},

Social Network Analysis and Network Science, have a long scholarly tradition.
From social diffusion models to protein-interaction networks, these complex-systems
disciplines cover a wide range of problems across scientific fields. Yet, although
these could be seen as wildly different, the object under the microscope is the
same, networks. 

With a long history (and insufficient levels of inter-discipline collaboration,
if you allow me to say) of scientific advances happing in a somewhat isolated
fashion, the potential of cross-pollination between disciplines within network
science is immense.

This book is an attempt to compile the many methods available in the realm of
complexity sciences, provide an in-depth mathematical examination--when possible--,
and provide a few examples illustrating their usage.
